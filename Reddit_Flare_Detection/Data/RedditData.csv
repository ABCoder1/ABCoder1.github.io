This is pretty much the biggest red-alert towards legal nootropics in the US.,1237,8r7ipn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8r7ipn/this_is_pretty_much_the_biggest_redalert_towards/,453,1529058254.0,"So essentially, there’s this bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act. It gives the DEA and the attorney general almost completely unchecked power to schedule any drug they see fit without following the currently established legal criteria to ban certain substances. In Section 2, Subsection 3B of the bill, this is the most worrying part that affects many different nootropics from phenibut to adrafinil or even kratom or tianepetine. 

“6)Schedule A
(A)In general
The drug or substance—

(i)has—

(I)a chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(II)an actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and

(ii)is not—

(I)listed or otherwise included in any other schedule in this section or by regulation of the Attorney General; and

(II)with respect to a particular person, subject to an exemption that is in effect for investigational use, for that person, under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to the extent conduct with respect to such substance is pursuant to such exemption.


(B)Predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect
For purpose of this paragraph, a predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system may be based on—

(i)the chemical structure, structure activity relationships, binding receptor assays, or other relevant scientific information about the substance;

(ii)

(I)the current or relative potential for abuse of the substance; and

(II)the clandestine importation, manufacture, or distribution, or diversion from legitimate channels, of the substance; or

(iii)the capacity of the substance to cause a state of dependence, including physical or psychological dependence that is similar to or greater than that of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V. “


This is concerning due to Phenibut having a similar pharmaceutical effect to Lyrica (schedule V) nd also being able to be (A) abused, and (B) can cause addiction or dependence similar to benzodiazepines or other GABApentinoids. 

Adrafinil is an analogue of Modafinil, a schedule IV drug, so it’s obvious why that could be banned immediately.

"I just learned that 10 minutes of ""wakeful rest"" (doing nothing / no sensory input) after learning was associated with 40% higher memory retrieval a week later. What are some other cognitive-enhancing phenomena everyone should know?",1174,afwze3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/afwze3/i_just_learned_that_10_minutes_of_wakeful_rest/,100,1547509296.0,"This is something that's important in a world with constant distraction: [Boosting Long-Term Memory via Wakeful Rest: Intentional Rehearsal Is Not Necessary, Consolidation Is Sufficient
](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109542). They gave two groups of people a free recall memory task. One group was then placed in a quiet room with no distractions for 10 minutes afterward, and the other group was given an additional cognitive task for 10 minutes afterward.

>Participants in the high sensory stimulation group completed 10 minutes of a spot-the-difference task, during which they were presented sequentially with 30 picture pairs on a laptop screen [2]. Their task was to identify and point to two differences between each picture pair within a 20-second time limit. Participants were instructed not to talk during the task, and care was taken to ensure that the spot-the-difference task was entirely visual: full instructions as well as a 1-minute practice trial were administered prior to Session 1 in order to minimalize verbalization during the delay. The spot-the-difference task was employed for two key reasons: firstly, it introduced new meaningful material and was cognitively demanding, thereby hampering word list consolidation [1]–[4], [6]. Secondly, it was non-verbal and highly unlike the word lists, thereby minimising potential interference at retrieval between word list memories and filler task memories [1], [2]. That is, the visual spot-the-difference task allowed us to examine the effect of sensory stimulation condition on word list consolidation specifically, without the potential confound of retrieval interference.

>Participants in the minimal sensory stimulation group were instructed to rest quietly in a darkened testing room while the experimenter went to ‘organize the next part of the study’ [2], [3]. To ensure minimal sensory stimulation, all equipment was turned off, and participants had no access to mobile phones, newspapers, etc.

What's interesting is that the additional cognitive task really wasn't that demanding, just pointing out two differences between laptops 30 times. That's not *so* dissimilar to making a comment on Reddit for 10 minutes, organizing your room for 10 minutes, etc. What this points to is the idea that you need rest not only *before* doing a cognitively-demanding task, but *immediately* afterward -- a 40% increase in material retrieval is absolutely insane. Even if commenting on Reddit is only 25% as cognitively demanding as pointing to differences in laptops, that's still a whopping 10% difference which is a full letter grade. 

I suppose to put this into practice you would need to take a 5 to 15 minute wakeful resting period after each chunk or subject that you are learning. So instead of stringing together programming / learning a language, you would pause for 10 minutes after each activity. You should also probably not text or move onto another task, unless the task is something that is similarly restful like walking.

What are some other psychological studies that people should know here?",2019-01-15 05:11:36

Got a threatening message from Cortex Labs - bizarre experience.,730,82q1b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/82q1b6/got_a_threatening_message_from_cortex_labs/,187,1520472602.0,"I rated Cortex Labs on Facebook without leaving a detailed review. Nearly instantaneous, they not only replied to this review, but also sent me a threatening private message:

""You're going to want to remove that review, before we subpoena FB to find the IP address and location of the account your using. You are not a customer of ours, and are posting negative reviews for personal reasons. You have 36 hours to remove this review.""

I then edited my review (and lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1) and added in the details of the private message they sent me. 

Their reply? 

""And that wasn't a threat. It's a promise. Our attorneys don't let people get away with fraudulent public slandering.""

Which is rather strange, considering my initial rating didn't contain a single written word, and the edit only mentioned the threatening message I received from them - so I'm not sure how that could be considered ""slanderous"" in any way.

I told my friend about this experience who then also took to the comments, and we were swiftly accused of being the same person.

Over the next hour, 5 5 star ratings mysteriously appear, raising their average rating again (some having a suspiciously similar writing style). 

Unfortunately, I have since found out [this isn't the first time Cortex Labs has acted very unprofessionally](https://imgur.com/a/qb2rf) and from these sudden 5 star ratings appearing, this also now adds some serious shadiness as well.

Needless to say, this was bizarre. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them?


/edit: It is interesting to review this post a few hours later. Ryan came here with a fake account himself, spewing insults while presenting himself as a personal ""friend"" (the same thing he actually accused others of). He has also now disabled the review section on his Facebook page completely, purging it of ALL reviews in an attempt to hide his poor behavior. 

His product (Cortex Nootropic Stack) can still be reviewed on Amazon.

I also found this [hilarious review](https://www.naturalnootropic.com/cortex-generation-1-review/) where he also felt the need to to vigorously engage with the author in the comments.

My advice to Ryan: Learn some customer relation skills, or even better: Just learn how to be a better person.

/edit 2:
It seems Ryan wasn't content just posting in this thread posing as a friend.

Now he's fighting back, and he has some choice words for users in this subreddit.

He talks about it in his [newest video](https://youtu.be/qnuJSQClxi8?t=36s), essentially calling everyone a loser (with a bad job).

He also mentions this Conor McGregor quote:

>Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

The irony of saying this while talking about other people (reddit users) seems to have been lost on him.

Unfortunately, it seems he didn't heed my advice about learning some customer relation skills or just being a better person.

All this over a wordless 2 star review that made him threaten me and claim my review was fake, because I didn't order this product from him. I guess he never realized I [could've just ordered it from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cortex-Nootropic-Stack-Performance-Monophospate/dp/B01N26XS8D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), or tried some from a friend?

At this point, I really do feel a little sorry for him - in his own words, he's supposedly a vet who was (or is still) suffering from PTSD. Of course that doesn't excuse his behavior, but I hope he realizes that acting the way he does certainly won't help him OR his business succeed.",2018-03-08 07:00:02

**Conclusion: Jarrow is entirely safe for consumption, as is pure nootropics.** I apologize for casting any doubt on their safety or quality.

edit: Hey everyone FYI, my post title was misleading - upon closer inspection the study focuses on ayurvedic medicines in general and not specifically ashwagandha. On top of that, it didn't study brands that are popular currently (the study is almost a decade old) and so is not by any means an accurate reflection of what you're likely to encounter while shopping online. So it's doubtful that 20% of the Ashwagandha available currently is contaminated with unsafe levels of toxic metals.

That being said, given that there is no regulatory oversight with these products, some amount of wariness and caution is always warranted to some degree.

/End Edit

Almost every post on here involves a few things that I find disturbing: 

1. Recommending something based off of short-term experience. I.e. “just took ashwaganda and it CURED my anxiety!” Chances are it didn’t cure your anxiety, it’s just a temporary patch for the symptoms. Many substances that have positive short-term effects end up being a negative in the long run. In fact, it’s usually the ones that feel the best at first that are the hardest to quit because of the permanent damage you’re doing to your neurotransmitters, and it’s often hard for us to even admit that they’re not good for us. 

2. Casually recommending dosages that are FAR too high for the average person. Everybody’s different, and not everyone should be trying a dosage that happens to work for you, especially because, let’s be frank, many of us are current/former drug users and require more stimulation to affect our mind and behavior. 

3. Underestimating side effects. This is kind of a corollary of the first two, but too often on here i see people saying stuff like “you could try theanine, it’s just an amino acid so there’s no risk”. Or “you don’t build a tolerance”. Regarding ANY psychoactive substance, which includes pretty much every nootropic mentioned on this sub (if you feel different, it’s psychoactive) including substances that we often tout as harmless like theanine or caffeine, you WILL build a tolerance, and this could lead to dependency. 

4. Recommending nootropics for sleep. Nootropics that help us fall asleep don’t necessarily give us BETTER sleep. Even if you feel more refreshed in the morning you may not necessarily be getting healthy sleep. Substances that affect your sleep hormones can change your sleep cycles, causing you to miss the right combination of light, deep, REM and other stages of sleep that all have their own specific purpose for repairing different parts of the body and mind. 
 
And taking these substances habitually to fall asleep will cause you to develop a dependency, meaning you’ll have an even tougher time falling asleep without that substance than you did before you ever took it. If you aren’t getting good sleep there are many other things you can try such as meditation, reducing light exposure at night, keeping a consistent bedtime routine, using your bed for the purpose of sleep ONLY, getting sunlight exposure and/or exercising early in the day, taking a hot shower an hour before bed so your body cools as you get ready for bed (which sends signals to your brain to start producing sleep hormones). 

5. Many of these substances are not well studied and we can’t assume they aren’t doing some sort of long-term damage. There are many things that have been a part of our everyday lives for years before we discovered the extent of their adverse health effects (tobacco, asbestos, sugar, plastics).

6. Assuming that a single benefit, even when proven through scientific study, means that a nootropic is worth taking. Just because a substance has a single benefit doesn’t mean that that benefit outweighs all the risks and damages. Green tea extract, for example, contains healthy anti-oxidants, but it’s also hard on the liver, and proper steps need to be taken to insure that damage to the liver is mitigated and determine whether it’s even worth taking at all. 

Additionally, many vitamins/supplements, while they may be useful to supplement if we are deficient in something essential, can be harmful when taken in excess or when they’re not needed. Many substances, such as magnesium and zinc, compete for absorption within the body, so that even though you may feel that you are helping yourself by supplementing magnesium to help aid digestion, for example, you may be causing a deficiency in zinc, which can cause diarrhea, hair loss, impotence, and all sorts of other health issues. It’s important to GET BLOODWORK done before supplementing and during, to know exactly how you’re affecting your body. Most people can just ask their primary care physician to get bloodwork done for a small fee.

I’m not saying that we should all stay away from nootropics. Some of them can be effective when taken responsibly, by:

1. easing into use with small dosages

2. cycling use

3. taking only one at a time to observe its effects on the body independent of other substances

4. weening one’s self off other more serious substances/drugs

5. After putting serious effort into trying more natural and safer methods that have proven to be more effective over time (meditation, exercise, healthy eating, 8 hours of sleep, hydrating), it’s often said, but is worth reiterating, that if exercise were sold in a pill people would pay top dollar for it. 

Lastly, many psychological issues, such as problems concentrating, anxiety, depression are the result of our lives’s circumstances and our inability to accept them and work to make them better. It may seem impossible at some points in our lives, but we could all benefit from finding people and things that we love and making those our priority. Love and a sense of purpose are more powerful forces than any nootropic out there.",2019-09-22 16:06:43

Why Your Nootropics Arent Working,566,dir6b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dir6b1/why_your_nootropics_arent_working/,191,1571269766.0,"I dove into noots about 10 years ago, around the time Dave Asprey was coming out of hiding and Modafanil was starting to get popular traction. I got involved because like everyone else here, I wanted to perform better in all areas of my life, especially my work, which is very technically obtuse and demanding. I took these compounds very seriously, and they have vastly improved my life.

Along the way I realized a few critical elements that caused ""non response"" to certain doses and compounds. Ive also read far too many accounts here on reddit and other  biohacking forums of people saying things like ""its a placebo"" or, ""This stuff doesn't work"".  If you're experiencing shitty results, id like to offer a few of my observations as to why:

1. ***Your Baseline sucks. -*** If you havent changed the oil in your car in over a year, neglected all your filters, drive on bald tires and generally avoid any maintenance, will a brand new performance exhaust and the most expensive racing fuel make your driving experience any better? If you want performance enhancement drugs to have an impact on your performance, you better make sure the basics are in order - Sleep, Reasonable Nutrition, Hydration and a host of other fundamental elements need to be tight if you want to step up your game with Nootropics. Your brain/body cant use energy systems you've been trashing with Mcdonalds and Vodka for a week.
2. ***You think Noots are NZT-like super drugs -*** This is the most common explanation for why people say ""X compound doesn't work"". No drug on the planet is going to motivate you to put the PlayStation controller down and do what you're supposed to be doing to elevate your life Game. YOU have to cultivate your own motivation to do what your laziness is currently keeping you from doing, and smart drugs will assist you once you get there. If your looking for a drug to ""make you do it"", Nootropics will always leave you disappointed. Take some initiative bro. There is no magic bullet, just bigger and better guns. 'still have to learn to shoot.
3. ***Youre not self-experimenting properly -*** There are about 30 compounds I can think of that will have a profound effect on your performance. Which of those is right for you and what doses can only be answered by one person: YOU. Theres no way a 275lb Bodybuilder with an I.Q. of 30 who sleeps 10 Hrs is going to have the same experience as a 19 y/o weakling studying for the BAR exam who sleeps 4H,  but for some reason, the biohacking community tends to lump these two together in terms of chemical reactions.Do legitimate self-experimental cycles, *one compound at a time,* for an extended period of time before you jump to a conclusion.
4. ***You're not dosing surgically -*** some compounds are only effective at a certain dose range, and that dose is going to be particular to YOUR body. Stop downing fistfuls of shit because you're ""Experienced with drugs, and have a high tolerance to pills"". Do your research. Separate the Signal from the Noise and understand what these compounds actually do inside you, what they deplete and what the consequences of use are. More is almost never better. Start low, and gradually increase if your self experimentation calls for it.
5. **You dont need chemical enhancement, you need to clean your room. -** When i was a competitive power lifter, I took a shit ton of steroids. Some people may argue with the morality of this, but they are clueless to the fact that its what you have to do if you want to win medals at a professional level in this sport, and compete with straight up bio-mutant humans on the platform.Because of my size and performance, Gym Rats and New-bros would ask me all the time, What should I take and what dose? My response was always this: Chemical Performance enhancement is level 10 shit. If your on level 0, meaning you skip the gym, skip meals, get dehydrated daily, drink out every night and sleep for 5 hours you have no biz taking performance enhancement drugs. You're just lazy and looking for a magic bullet. Earn your right to take things to the next level, stop trying to cheat yourself. Come back when you're level 9.

**TLDR: Your Baseline is fucked. You dont sleep enough, eat shitty foods, treat your body & spirit like trash, and expect a pill to turn you into Elon Musk overnight. Drink more water, consume less carbs and social media, get 30 min of light exercise daily, make your bed everyday and I bet a dollar to a doughnut your Noots will ""work"" better.**",2019-10-17 05:19:26

Fruit and vegetable consumption and cognitive decline in aging women.

Kang JH1, Ascherio A, Grodstein F.

Abstract

We prospectively examined fruit and vegetable intake in relation to cognitive function and decline among aging women. Participants were followed from in 1976 with biennial questionnaires, and food frequency questionnaires were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 years thereafter. From 1995 to 2001, we administered, by telephone, six cognitive tests measuring general cognition, verbal memory, category fluency, and working memory. We repeated assessments two years later for 13,388 women (>90% follow-up). We averaged dietary intakes from 1984 through the first cognitive assessment, and used linear regression to obtain multivariable-adjusted mean differences in performance and decline in performance across intake levels. **Fruits were not associated with cognition or cognitive decline. However, total vegetable intake was significantly associated with less decline**. Specifically, on a global score combining all tests, women in the highest quintile of **cruciferous vegetables** declined slower (by 0.04 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.003, 0.07; p trend = 0.1) compared with the lowest quintile. Women consuming the most **green leafy** vegetables also experienced slower decline than women consuming the least amount (by 0.05 unit; 95% confidence interval, 0.02, 0.09; p trend < 0.001). These mean differences were equivalent to those observed for women about 1 to 2 years apart in age.

Cerebral Health Pyritinol Test Results (WARNING),497,1mmip9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/,229,1379510752.0,"Many of you may remember the issue that came up with Cerebral Health/Bioscience Nutraceuticals a few months ago, where their choline bitartrate was numbing people's mouths. After sending those samples in to the lab, the tests came back negative for choline bitartrate. We suspected it was choline salacylate, but decided further testing to ascertain the exact compound would not be worth the cost. Unfortunately that was not the last issue to come from Cerebral Health.

A few weeks ago, another Redditor placed an order pyritinol from CH, along with some alpha GPC and oxiracetam. When the order arrived, both the alpha GPC and oxiracetam seemed alright. However, the pyritinol seemed off. Before thinking about it, he took his normal 400mg dose of pyritinol and went out for a mountain bike ride. Within 15-20 minutes he was getting a weird euphoria and detachment. After another couple minutes, his memory gets very fuzzy. 

Eventually his sister found him in the garage in a manic/psychotic state. He was biting his lips very hard, shaking, and holding his fists tight. Eventually he went into seizures when the paramedics came. He was taken to the hospital and seized again while waiting for the doctor. He had a crazed look in his eyes like what you see with people having a psychotic episode on MDPV. He was in the hospital for 4 days.

Not putting two and two together yet, he tried another small dose of pyritinol a few days after getting home, to see what effects came back. Sure enough, he started to get the euphoria and disassociation that he felt before. He also got the same crazed look in his eyes, and same rolling nystagmus. It tasted nothing like pyritinol, but more like burnt plastic. His cognition was off for a while due to the seizures, but he was sure it was the Cerebral Health pyritinol that caused it.

After doing some searching for similar reactions and physical properties online, he came to the conclusion that the compound was most likely a cathinone derivative like MDPV. All the effects fit with an overdose on something like MDPV. Since 400mg is a normal dose for pyritinol, but a massive dose for MDPV, that is most likely what caused the blackout and seizures. Since then he has been having intermittent seizures, and has been back in the hospital 3 times.

After speaking with the other moderators, we decided we needed to send a sample into the lab to get this tested. To prevent any accusations of tampering with the sample, I had another moderator order a whole new bag from them, then send a sample from that into the lab to be tested. So we now have two samples of the compound in question. The original one that sent the Redditor to the hospital, and the separate order we placed right after we became aware of the issue. Today the results came back, and it tested negative for pyritinol. I spoke to Colin at the lab, and he said that the FTIR did not match up at all, and that it was a completely unrelated compound. Due to legal constraints, the lab did not want to do a full workup on the compound apart from confirming it was not pyritinol. So we are going to be sending another sample from the same batch to Dacesafe.org to do a full workup. It will tell us exactly what the compound is, and what purity level it is at.

[Here is the result from Colmeric](http://i.imgur.com/cCOCMUs.jpg)

So in light of this, I suggest that nobody purchases anything from Cerebral Health. This is the second instance in the last 6 months where they have been selling a completely different substance than what it was advertised as. In this particular instance, it could even be a dangerous and illegal substance. Until we do a full workup, I cannot say for sure if this substance was MDPV or another cathinone derivative. However, it is definitely a psychoactive compound other than pyritinol. Obviously a lawyer is going to be brought in by the Redditor that went to the hospital, so I may have to take certain statements down eventually. However, I want everyone to be aware of this serious issue before it potentially puts another person in the hospital!

**EDIT: After further testing, the substance was identified as diphenhydramine (Benadryl).**

In his latest podcast (with Sinclair which was super interesting) he says he takes 3 different nootropic supps all of which have multiple ingredients. 

One of them is trubrain which is-

>L-theanine, Caffeine, Uridine, Centrophenoxine, Magnesium, Tyrosine, N-Acetyl Carnitine, Citicholine, Monk Fruit, Mangosteen, Nopal Concentrate, Noopept, Cane Sugar, Blue Agave, Purified Water, Xylitol, Nisin, Polylysine.

Okay so now what if you have a negative reaction to that? how on earth would you determine which specific ingredient you reacted to? same with a positive reaction. Its possible only one of those ingredients is helping you and the rest are just doing nothing or actually doing damage to your brain chemistry. You dont know!  

Also there are multiple cholinergic substances in that. Too much of that can fuck you up. 

Now consider he ALSO is taking 2 other nootropic supplement which ALSO have multiple ingredients! This is like 30 - 40 nootropic ingredients this man is sucking down for shits and giggles.

He seems to be following the ""Just take ALL the nootropics ALL the time! More and more! Balls to the Wall! Fuck yeah!"" approach

sorry but that if FUCKING STUPID! You are messing with your brain chemistry and turning your body into a ongoing chemistry experiment. Bad. Wrong. No. Dont do it, dont follow his lead. 

Do ONE nootropic at a time, see how you react and then adjust accordingly. 

Fucking Rogan man. How can he be so smart and so fucking stupid at the same time? 

Sorry for the rant but geez louise, this is how you get an industry over regulated.

The biggest mistake beginners make with nootropics,472,cv16e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cv16e5/the_biggest_mistake_beginners_make_with_nootropics/,55,1566720345.0,"I've been testing all kinds of nootropics, supplements and even prescription strength medications for over 15 years, and I've seen a really big issue.  


How many times have you or read about someone taking a supplement and, suddenly, they are cured.  
They have an amazing day. They feel great. Pain is gone, or energy is up. Mood is transformed.   
Everything clicks.  


So much of the testimony on this subreddit is actually these types of account. First day. First week. First 2 weeks.   


But, then what happens?  
The effects are gone. The person returns to baseline. And the whole thing might be forgotten. No long term progress is achieved. 

There are 2 causes for this.   
(1) The placebo effect. (2) A ""Triggering"" effect   


The placebo effect has been well documented and studied so I won't go into it.  
The ""Triggering"" effect is the one I want to highlight because this is where the problem happens.  


Human beings naturally go through mood cycles. Happy days. Sad days. Angry days.   
These moods can even last for few days or even a week or two.   


In the most intense example we have hypo-manic disorder. Where you have extreme episodes alternating between ecstatic/high energy/euphoria/happiness/motivation followed by episodes of depression/irritability/hopelessness.   


That's the most extreme example and it's not something seriously effecting most people. But, the key is understanding these mood cycles.   


As a person goes through their life, they will naturally go through  these sad/happy/angry/etc mood cycles -- btw there is no specific rhythm to this other than a high energy/low energy rhythm mediated by the para-sympathetic/sympathetic nervous system. And all this will happen WITHOUT any supplementation.   


So, when you take a supplement and you happen to be ""ready"" for a positive mood, then that action helps trigger that mood. It's similar to how if a person gets a complement or a kind gesture, and they feel incredible.   


So it's critical to distinguish the intrinsic effects of the supplement versus the natural cycles that are happening.   


Having said that, what's the solution?   
The most important thing is to STOP looking for a ""silver bullet"" or magical cure.   
Most nootropics & supplements offer little immediate cognitive benefits. And those that do, will give you a boost. But they won't ""cure"" you.   


The key is to understand that ""you"" are the cure.   
The quality of your life comes from the quality of your living.   
It's how you sleep, eat, move.   
It's how you take care of yourself mentally and emotionally.  
It's the quality of relationships and deeper meaning to life.   


That's what personally helped me the most, is when I stopped trying to find ""a cure"" and realize that all of life is an on-going process, and I can achieve my goals if I continue to make improvements.   


In that sense, ""fatigue"" or ""low energy"" isn't a ""on/off"" switch.   
It's not binary.   
You aren't tired OR energetic.   
It's a gradient. A scale.

And then it's about asking the question:   
""How do I add more positive inputs to achieve my outcome?""   
And all kinds of nootropics and supplements are part of the process.   


But, ultimately it's so important to stop living life in terms of ""singular events"" i.e. I took a supplement and now my depression is gone. And then if the supplement stops working a few days later, then ""the cure"" has failed and you are back to square 1. It's all an on-going process. You are the scientist of your body and your life, and you continuously conduct experiments to see what works and what does. And then you do more of what works, and less of what doesn't.  


I'm sharing this because this is the biggest piece of advice I'd give myself 15 years ago, because I ended up wasting years and years trying all kinds of ""one time cures"" and not making progress. It wasn't until I embraced the ""process based""/holistic mindset, that I started to achieve my health/mind goals with the help of nootropics.",2019-08-25 13:35:45

Let me know if you want me to go into more detail on any of them or if you have any questions. If some of you find this list helpful I can make more lists of nootropics I’ve tried for different symptoms (mood, cognition, social anxiety, anhedonia). Check out my early post history for more reviews or my old account which I lost the password to and can not access anymore (/u/Nedzilla55). Anyways, here’s my list of 20 not-so-well-know (and a few we’ll know) nootropics/supplements. They’re listed in no particular order.



1) Pantogam and Pantogam Activ - Feels somewhat like Phenibut lite, without the extreme tolerance. Effects are not as intense as phenibut or Baclofen but it’s a nice little anxiolytic which is somewhat energizing as well (as strange as that sounds). Almost like a couple of drinks. Made it easier for me to just be myself (as weird as that sounds). You may find yourself humming in the car or listening to music while doing goofy dance moves from the early 2000s. Makes it easier to laugh and just enjoy myself while being in the moment.


2) Low Dose Amisilpride (12.5mg - 25mg). Don’t let the antipsychotic label scare you: that’s only at regular doses. At very low doses, it enhances dopamine transmission and facilitates dopamineric neurotransission and is a wonderful “as needed” mood brightener. Great for anhedonia. Helps to feel more “in the moment” and makes things like conversations with others more enjoyable.


3) Tenoten - Didn’t feel much from this one unfortunately. It’s supposed to work for anxiety and stress. Not too many experience reports online either (In English, at least). Might as well have been a sugar pill.


4) GABOB - Brain fog, sleepy ness, sedation... not a fan of this one. Benadryl type feeling almost. Not enjoyable at all and overall letdown IME.


5) Picamilon - Developed by Soviet Russia, this is considered a pro drug of GABA. It can be somewhat energizing or anxiolytic depending on the dose. Very subtle though, possible placebo effect. I haven’t found too many positive experiences online with this one either.


6) Agomelatine - This atypical antidepressant is an agonist at the melatonin receptors along with 5-HT2C antagonist. Helps me fall asleep when taken before bedtime, but has an activating/energizing feel upon waking up. Good alternative to try if you’ve had no luck with conventional antidepressants. I've read experience reports about it causing irritation at higher doses. I have not experienced this but YMMV.


7) Afobazole - This obscure little Ruski supplement feels somewhat anxiolytic but effects were pretty subtle to me. I may revisit this one with a higher dosage 


8) Sarcosine+NAC - Ok so this one may not be very obscure but I enjoy its effects so I figured I’d at least share. NAC literally cured my trichtillomania. It’s an amazing antioxidant. Taken an hour before drinking it prevents hangovers IME. Sarcosine is great for anhedonia and other “negative symptoms”. Makes it easier to engage with others and “feel”.


9) Grandaxin - This is an interesting one. Its commonly described as “anxiolytic” and “tranquilizing” though I would not really agree with that description. It’s an It feels activating physically yet quiets the mind. Too big of a dose caused irritability


10) Stresam - Nice little anxiolytic. Helps calm the mind and body. I like it to unwind after a stressful day at work. Puts me in a nice chill state when kicking back and watching documentaries or hanging out in nature


11) BPC-157 - Apparently it’s good for reducing stimulant tolerance and injuries? Again another one that may not be very obscure but I thought it may be of interest to some of you. 


12) Nefiracetam - I love this one. Nice little mood brightener. It’s hard to explain but it helps me connect the dots at work and when doing everyday activities. It makes it easy for me to read between the lines, especially in work/social situations. It’s almost like it makes me feel more aware. Like I was brushing my teeth one day on it and I just zoned out to the feeling of the bristles of my toothbrush going against my teeth and gums and just kind of had me in the moment. It made me think “why do I wet my toothbrush, maybe it’s better to leave it dry because the toothpaste sticks better to the toothbrush and my teeth”. This may or may not be wrong but I’ve had similar epiphanies on it. That may sound dumb but I don’t know how to better describe its effect on me. I wish someone would have this in stock again :(


13) Oxytocin - I took it before an interview and had the best interview in my life. I was so engaged with the interviewer and felt like we already had some sort of connection. It was very easy to express myself. My girlfriend said I was very romantic (lol) when I took it before going out to dinner with her (which is sort of unusual for me). Great for deep convos and connecting with others. This is one of those that I can clearly rule out a placebo effect.


14) Sulbutiamine - I had high hopes for this one but unfortunately did not feel much of anything despite trying many different doses. People on here and Longecity reported energizing effects. Maybe I’m just a non-responder?


15) Galantamine - this one is a cholinesterase inhibitor . Perefct for those who enjoy lucid dreaming. Increases acetylcholine in the brain, which may or may not be a good thing based on your personal neurochemistry. 


16) Semax - These next 2 are not very obscure to those familiar with nootropics but felt I should include them for some reason. This one is activating. I really like it for jogging, hiking, and other outdoor activities.


17) Selank - Semax’s chill twin brother. This one is more anxiolytic. I really enjoy walks in the woods with this one for some reason. Or just sitting on my back porch enjoying the nice weather and scenery.


18) P-21 - R.I.P. Ceretropic :( not sure if this is available anymore but I enjoyed its effects. It had more of an activating feel in my experience. Somewhat anxiogenic at times even. Not in a bad way though. Effects are hard to describe with this one.


19) D-Cycloserine - This one “aids in learning by helping form stronger neural connections”. Good for exposure therapy. I have a feeling this one would work much better when combined with CBT


20) GTS-21 - this one is a partial agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is a horrible smelly yellow substance with a repulsive taste and it leaves yellow stains on anything it touches, including your hands. Felt somewhat anxiolytic though activating at the same time. I’ve only taken it for a week though. I may need to take it for a longer period of time to really feel its effects though. I will trial it for a month and report back it’s effects.",2019-04-13 15:27:49

"After two years of development, we've made the first caffeien + L-theanine nootropic gum!",417,3kgtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3kgtz4/after_two_years_of_development_weve_made_the/,227,1441953049.0,"Hey r/nootropics!

Nearly two years ago, my brother (best friend) and I began working on NeuroGum, the first sugar-free caffeine + L-theanine nootropic gum. We saw all these other companies charging exorbitant amounts of money simply encapsulating caffeine and L-theanine, and we began brainstorming ways of creating an alternative that was delicious, affordable, and also portable. Beyond that, we wanted a way of making nootropics more accessible to the average consumer.

&nbsp;

So we borrowed some money and began experimenting by putting caffeine and L-theanine into a gum base. Of course, that first iteration tasted terrible and it crumbled apart. After a few unsuccessful attempts, we finally began working with a certified gum chemist, and over a dozen iterations later, we finally found a way of cold compressing:

* 40mg of caffeine
* 60mg of L-theanine
* 30% Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
* 100% Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)

into a piece of gum. Instead of aspartame, we used sorbitol, stevia, and a natural mint + vanilla flavor mix to mask the flavors and created our very own nootropic gum!

&nbsp;
        
I wanted to share to this subreddit because the amazing content here changed my life. We've been working super hard for the last two years and just launched on Indiegogo today. With the money we raise, we can finish our first production run and get our gum out to as many people as possible.

&nbsp;

You can pre-order here on our Indiegogo page: http://igg.me/at/neurogum

and you can also check out our website at www.neurogum.com!

Once we launch, I promise I'll be back with some coupon codes for everyone here! If there's any questions, feel free to ask! This is my personal account so I'll be lurking in and out between shifts all day.

Cheers guys!

&nbsp;


**EDIT: Wow. I'm absolutely thrilled. Yesterday, our Indiegogo campaign reached our goal, and now we can pay to finish our first production run. It's been such an overwhelming experience receiving feedback, support, and wonderful discussion for all of you here. After we talk with our manufacturer first thing tomorrow morning, we are going to begin working on some stretch goals like different flavors and our L-theanine gum.**

**This subreddit has been so amazing, and I can't be more grateful. Thank you all so much!**
 
**SO, for everyone who has already ordered, we sped up the timeline! We are going to work hard to get the gum shipped out as quickly as possible! We'll finalize the order tomorrow, receive it in two weeks, then set up something to get it out to you. I can't wait for you all to try NeuroGum!**

&nbsp;

**EDIT (PART 2): After feedback, we dropped our price so NeuroGum is less than $3 a pack! Code Redditropics also gives an extra 10% off so you'll get it for even less :)

[A human study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425476) found that 3 months of daily Magnesium supplementation are needed to significantly increase RBC (Red Blood Cell) Magnesium levels. The study used Magnesium Di-Malate (supplement form is usually Magnesium Mono-Malate, should be similar), and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as it is known B6 improves Magnesium absorption.

After 30 days, the participants had a 6% higher RBC Mg content. After 90 days, however, the participants had a 30% higher RBC Mg content, which is considered a significant increase. The 6% increase at 30 days could be beneficial as well, but it shows that restoring normal Magnesium stores in the body can take a long time.

Magnesium Malate is known to be well absorbed, but even with its good absorption, it can take as long as 3 months to fix a deficiency. 

****

It seems like many people here decide that a certain Magnesium supplement is useless, after only a few weeks on it, and then switch to another one that they claim to find more effective. What might actually be happening, is that the multiple weeks of being on the first Magnesium supplement partially fixed the deficiency, making the second Magnesium supplement build on top of that, hence having more noticeable effects.",2018-09-13 09:36:19

I recently purchased 100g of what i believed to be Piracetam from Cerebral Health. After 3 days of dosing 2g in the morning i now feel what can only be described as brain damaged. I can no longer form coherent sentences, my memory is, well, ruined! I also find it hard to concentrate on anything which i found alarming so i contacted ""Professor Douglas. J. Phillips"", the owner of CH who i found to be not helpful whatsoever. I mean this guy flat out denied any problems with his products which is a complete lie! He asked about my diet which is fine, i also abstain from drinking alcohol albeit i was a heavy drinker in the past, and had a brief history of Cocaine use but that was years ago. I admitted this to help with Phillip's personal assessment but he stopped playing doctor by then and didn't reply.

After doing a google search on this SOB i found some alarming results:

**""David Ira Minkoff, M.D., who testified on Phillips's behalf, also had serious trouble. On August 3, 2001, the Florida Board of Medicine fined him $10,000 and suspended his license for one year, to be followed by two years of probation [3]. Minkoff, a Scientologist, was implicated in the death of Lisa McPherson, a Scientologist who allegedly died of malnutrition while in the custody of other Scientologists. Documents in the case indicate that even though Minkoff had never met McPherson, he prescribed sedative medication by telephone to Church of Scientology staff members who had called on her behalf. Although admitting no guilt, Minkoff reached a $100,000 settlement in 1997 in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by McPherson's estate.""**

**In June 2010, Department of Health investigators came to Phillips' office as undercover patients.

I threatened to inform every nootropic related forum about my experience and all he had to say was:

Like i care...

He's not even a professor, just some charlatan who gives people whacky alterative therapy. Anyways there's a growing number of reports detailing peoples' bad experiences with supplements purchased from CH that are not what they say they are. One of which is detailed here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1mmip9/cerebral_health_pyritinol_test_results_warning/


Whether or not it's Benadryl that i've taken an overdose of is for the doctors to find out. I have pain in my kidney areas and urine smells really foul, not that piss is suppose to smell nice anyway lol. I'm going for a blood test Monday and have been told to bring along the ""Piracetam"" so it can be tested. I have contacted the FDA who are very interested and also want me to send a sample. If there's any long term damage caused i'm not going to give up till this guy is finished!


Mr. Phillips also posts on http://brainmeta.com/forum/ under the pseudonym of ""GodConsciousness"", discrediting any bad experiences as companies merely trying to stain his already bad reputation. LOL! Not to mention his company sponsors the brainmeta forum (facepalm).

Yes, this is my fault and i agree i should have done more research before purchasing but if i can prevent this from happening to someone else i'll be happy.

In no particular order: Some of the Supplements/Herbs/Nootropics I’ve tried over the years and my overall subjective summary of them:,382,d1ees4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d1ees4/in_no_particular_order_some_of_the/,133,1567994558.0,"**Noopept:** (10-40mg) intervals, once per day, every-so often: Odd headspace, sometimes feels like I can focus more, sometimes less, pretty unpredictable when it comes to cognition. Does something to my visual perception which is hard to describe (like my vision gets grainier but it seems my ability to visually focus is better?). Often get very minor headaches. Underwhelming and not useful imo. Very subtle. May experiment again because it wasn’t “bad” but didn’t seem beneficial in any way. Seems to last about 6-8hrs but it’s hard to gauge. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Piracetam:** multi-gram dosage, once per day for a few weeks: Similar to noopept in the sense that something happens to my vision (like my vision gets grainier but it seems my ability to visually focus is better?), no real change in ability to focus etc. Underwhelming and not useful imo. Very subtle but probably placebo. Might experiment again because it wasn’t “bad” but didn’t seem beneficial in any way.

**Phenylpiracetam:** 100mg/day-200mg/day. Moderate to strong ability to help me focus on one activity to completion whether it be cognitive or physical exertion. Stimulation, but no euphoria, maybe a slight mood boost in a motivational way. Partially blunts emotions. Causes focus mode. May cause insomnia if taken too late. Seems to pair well with caffeine although you can overdo it, so sip the caffeine slowly. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Coluracetam:** 25mg sublingual/day. Within 45 minutes my vision changes, there is what seems to be a sensitivity to light in an enjoyable way such that there is a very subtle halo about objects/colors. Aesthetic of color does seem to be enhanced. Causes good cognitive focus for about 4 hours. May cause stomach upset (dry heaving/vomiting) within 45 minutes of taking. Disclaimer: Research Chem.

**Phenibut:** 600mg. takes about 1-3 hours to kick in. Waves of relaxation, and uplifts mood in a non-euphoric way. Relaxation increases and peaks about 6 hrs. later. Sleep is very easy, very refreshing, dreams can be deep/vivid and lucid dreaming is promoted. In total lasts about 16-24 hours. There can be an after-glow which can feel very nice, like a mild body-high post-morning. Disclaimer: May cause headaches but uncommon (\~1/10 times), may cause constipation. May cause addiction/habit formation, may cause hangover.

**PRL-853:** 5-20mg dose. Strong numbing effect on oral mucosa. Changes in headspace, similar to noopept. Causes distinct grainy-resolution change in my vision, but it’s hard to tell if it’s better or worse. The effect seems very similar to noopept. Moderate feeling of focus. Lasts about 4 hours. Disclaimer: Research Chem.

**Tianeptine:** sodium at 8mg/dose, sulfate at 25-30mg/dose. Moderately opioid, definitively relaxing and mood stabilizing/uplifiting. Moderately addictive (especially sodium). Causes weak waves of wellbeing. Sodium lasts about 2-3hrs, sulfate lasts about 6hrs. Sulfate onset is smoother and lasts longer without sharp peak, sodium peak is stronger but dissipates faster. Causes increased food intake/hunger. If taken over the course of a few days, causes distinct type-pimples/carbuncles which are usually localized in the facial region \[researching this, I found that Amineptine (a similar tianeptine analogue) causes this side-effect\]. Taken only once a week at doses described for no discernable side-effects. Take more than dosage described and side-effects increase exponentially. May cause headaches (\~1/20th time) Best if taken at night. Disclaimer: opioid addiction, rapid tolerance when taken chronically, little research.

**Skullcap tincture** (Scutellaria baicalensis): (a few drops to a full dropper) Odd bodily sensations, dysphoria, stopped after second experience which was identical. Terrible ime. Will never do again.

**Hops tincture:** (2 dropper fulls) helps with peripheral relaxation but not so much cognitive. Makes me relaxed for about 2 hours but then have a rebound effect of a lot of energy, similar to my experience with alcohol (probably due to GABA agonism rebound)

**Glycine:** relaxing, helps with sleep at high dose (9.0g) at night but gives grogginess/lethargy post-awakening. Grogginess/lethargy attenuated with mixing with .7g proline + 1.0g taurine. Glycine has to be dosed high initially (3.0g), and then the other 6.0g glycine + .7g proline + 1.0g taurine in 1-2 cups of water, makes a nice semi-sweet relaxing pre-sleep drink. Very useful for relaxation/sleep in high dose

**Taurine:** 1.0g at night or in the morning. Relaxing but not to the same extent as glycine. Seems to help with stress. Helps with sleep. Does not on its own cause lethargy like glycine. Subtle but useful

**Proline:** 0.7g in conjunction with taurine and glycine due to its good synergy. Added this to glycine/taurine stack to mimic collagen since collagen has high proline-glycine content. See glycine post on dose mixtures.

**Melatonin:** for sleep, inconsistent, does not help overall ime

**Ashwaganda KSM-66:** 100-mg intervals. Apathy, amotivation, tendency for strong anxiolysis to the detriment of mood. Reduces motivation too much for my liking. Will never do again.

**Corydalis tincture** *(Corydalis yanhusuo)***:** containing tetrahydropalmatine: Makes me tried but is anxiogenic, causes visual distortions and random visual and auditory hallucinations, mostly in the form of closed eye rapidly-fluctuating visuals, dysphoria. Absolutely horrible ime. Lasts about 4 hours. Gives me a toxic feeling. Will likely never take again.

**Green Tea Extract (high ECGC content):** Dosed once a week for a few months: 1st time I did this I was straight euphoric/high, similar to cannabis, lasted 6 hours, I was totally conked out. After 1st time, made me very tired, and gave me a moderate body high, lasts about 5-6 hrs. Makes eyes heavy, makes body tired. Does not help with cognition, causes cognitive lethargy, although feels somewhat refreshing after use/experience. Consistent effects after 1st experience. Disclaimer: Green tea extract has been linked to liver disease/damage

**Sulbutiamine:** Gives energy, slightly euphoric, feels addictive, causes craving feelings. Has given me partial rash on random localized area of skin, generally in a vein-protruding region, but uncommon (\~1/20 incidence), but I have attributed to sulbutiamine so I rarely if ever use it anymore. Goes away within 30 min if symptom exists. Sometimes get headaches/stomach aches but they are minor. Lasts about 4 hours at 200mg/dose. Disclaimer: May be hepatotoxic long term, may cause kidney problems

edit: added disclaimer of kidney problems

**Uridine:** 50mg/day morning. Gives energy, feels like a mood-buffer. Antidepressant in my experience. Better when paired with choline source since the choline seems to be more cerebral and the uridine seems to promote the choline effect. Lasts about 4-6 hrs. Good for morning dosing. No noticeable side-effects ime.

**Choline in any form:** 200mg, clears up brain fog, very-very rarely 1/50 times may cause headache, but I think this is due to happen with limited hydration. Good for extending energy later on in the day rather than caffeine. Lasts about 3hrs. Great when paired with uridine in morning, without uridine later in the day. This is probably one of my favorite supplements due to its rapid onset of action, and its practical absence of side-effects. I've been currently using alpha-GPC due to getting it at discount a while back.

**Rhodiola tincture:** In my experience this works better than any powder salidroside/rosavin (although salidroside powder works ok). Gives a lot of energy, but has a high tolerance, have to cycle it every 3 days because it loses its effects. Side effects of use occur after 2nd day of use, include a kind of ocular accommodative dysfunction where it’s hard to focus (I forget the medical term) and eyes are like locked-forward. Energy is strong, but peripheral and somato rather than cerebral. May cause insomnia if taken too late into the day even by day 1. Excellent when mixed with caffeine source.

**Ephedra tincture:** Cardiac/peripheral energy. Way too much to my liking. Helps with decongestion. Highly bronchodilating and peripherally vasoconstricting. Makes you want to run!! Sympathomimetic effects highly sensitive/enhanced. Lasts \~2-3 hrs. Post-experience causes grogginess/lethargy. Too strong on circulatory system for my liking. Gives a similar eye-locked forward feeling with prolonged use of rhodiola. Disclaimer: May cause death/cardiac arrest

**Mucuna pruriens extract:** Definitely feels dopaminergic, but not euphoric, causes cognitive relaxation, causes hunger and I definitely have eaten more on it. Gives an odd head-space/dreamy-like but not euphoric in any way.

**Bromantane:** sublingual 35mg, still in my process of gauging effects. Lasts a long time, probably 16 hrs. Sleep is difficult but not impossible. It does feel like I was awake and didn’t sleep at all, but when I get up I feel refreshed/felt like I had enough relaxing which doesn’t seem to cause problems post-experience. Gives subtle energy boost, and seems to boost mood (has a minor glow-like effect, I think some people call this god-mode) and cognitive focus albeit in a mild-fashion. Disclaimer: Lack of Long Term Rigorous Research

**Nutmeg:** The powder at about 10grams (generally mixed with ice-cream) causes intoxication about 3-8 hrs later. The intoxication lasts about 32-48hrs. May cause some stomach discomfort/headaches. Variable on sleep, usually disturbs sleep but is relaxing/enjoyable enough ime that this isn’t an issue. Causes mydriasis, xerostomia (dry mouth) and ocular vasodilation (red eyes). You do not want to do this more than once per two weeks or it will cognitively slow-you (ime), similar to cannabis intoxication. The pure essential oil gives a smoother experience, without as much stomach discomfort/headaches although they do occur. Unlike the powder, the oil may cause esophageal irritation/inflammation in addition to oil burps (which are not appealing ime). 4-8 drops of oil in peanut butter/chocolate/Nutella. I do not recommend the oil, the powder is much stronger, lasts longer and is more enjoyable from my experience. YMMV. Some people absolutely hate this and makes them sick, but people I know say I have an iron stomach. Disclaimer: May be poisonous, death at high  dosage, may cause seizures

edit: Disclaimers due to unfounded information on hepatoxicity

**Kava extract** (high kavalactone content): Very subtle relaxation. May be enjoyable but is variable in my experience. Sometimes stomach discomfort. May help with sleep. Better taken as an afternoon-nighttime for relaxing effects. Disclaimer: May be hepatotoxic at high/chronic doses

**Adrafinil:** 125mg, immediately on wake-up with minimum two cups of liquid. Takes about 30 minutes to fully kick in. Strongly eugeroic (wakefulness promoting) and stimulating. Lasts about 10hrs. Focus/energy/antifatigue. I have felt a moderate body-high. Great for waking but excellent when sleep-deprived. Often causes constipation if not enough liquids drank throughout the day. Seems to require doubling the amount of liquids you consume throughout day to be effective/minimize side-effects. May cause minor headaches, stomach aches and constipation. Not recommended daily but cycled every other or every 3 days. Disclaimer: May cause insomnia (heptotoxicity has not truly been demonstrated)

edit: Disclaimers due to unfounded information on hepatoxicity

**Zembrin** (*Scletium tortuosum* extract\*)\***:** 25mg sublingual. Difficult to handle powder, extremely hygroscopic. Tastes salty, gives an interesting cerebral headspace. Seems to change vision slightly similar to racetams. Feels serotonergic, good for focus. Seems to stabilize mood although I’ve felt it blunts compassion and may cause mild aggression. Lasts about 6-8hrs. Gives a relatively clear headspace. May cause minor headaches although somewhat uncommon (\~1/10 times)

**Areca Catechu:** (chewed slices): Within a few minutes causes rapid relaxation of body and mind, uplifts mood, causes drowsiness and mild-euphoria, occasionally lower appendage (quadriceps) muscle spasms, increases oral mucus production. Lasts about 0.75-1hr. May cause minor headache after, may cause mouth irritation. Disclaimer: May cause cancer.

**Thunbergia laurifolia:** still experimenting, 350mg capsules, . 1st time with 700mg causes clear dopaminergic headspace similar to first time ECGC. Mild body high. Strong relaxation and sleep promoting. Rapid tolerance such that 4x dose needed to deliver similar effects, although after the 1st time, the mild body-high and relaxation is significantly reduced similar to EGCG. Lasts about 2-3hrs.

**Kratom:**  (split into Red/White) because I think these are the most distinct,  Green is closer to white, and Maeng da is closer to red without as much  pruritus

Red: 3-6 full tablespoons  in about 1-2 cups of tea (mint) with added sugar, sipped over the  course of 1 hour, generally in the morning. Slightly numbing to the  mouth, feel effects in about 20-30 minutes. Causes great initial feeling  of wellbeing/euphoria/antidepressant, significant perceptual increase  in temperature throughout and after experience. Wellbeing/euphoria  slowly peaks at about 1-2 hours and then smooths out to an ending of  total of 8 hours from start. Starts low but tends towards strong body  high/tactile pleasure throughout the experience. Mild feelings of  craving/addictive potential especially initially. Initial feeling is  sometimes angiogenic and very stimulating but it can also be anxiolytic  (less so on initial come up), followed (after a few hours) a feeling of  lethargy, heavy eyes, slight mydriasis and heroic pruritus\[itching\]  (depending on dosage). A lower dose is good for doing manual/physical  exertion that doesn't require too much cognition like working out or  working in a garden or running/jogging. Notable lapses in memory similar  to cannabis, limited attention span (exacerbates ability to focus). May  cause insomnia, sleep is almost impossible if taken too late in the  day, but you can stay in bed relaxed itching in ""body-high glory"". Red  seems to cause more pruritus than white or green or Maeng da. Erections  are possible, but orgasm is near impossible. Post-waking, there can be  residual pruritus, but often I perceive a beautiful body-after glow that  feels like my skin is refreshed. Opioid effects are \~8hrs, and  completely back to baseline about 24hrs after experience (meaning no  more pruritus/kratom-feelings). Tolerance rapidly increases similar to  traditional opiates. Not advised more than once a week due to addiction  potential and insomnia issues. Disclaimer: Addictive/habit forming.

White:  Same dose, same way as Red. Difference is that White is more  stimulating, peaks faster, and stays more stimulating than tending  towards relaxing throughout the experience. Less pruritus but still  significant. Tendency to be more anxiogenic than Red. White lasts about  2hrs less than red, so about 6 instead of 8hrs. Same as Red in the sense  that craving/addictive, partial mydriasis, notable lapses in memory  similar to cannabis, exacerbates ability to focus cognitively, good for  physical exercise, insomnia if taken too late, possible erections, near  to impossible orgasm etc...

Edit: Kratom- may cause jitters similar to caffeine, but I've found this is variable depending on batch

"[A comprehensive guide] LSD and MDMA for permanent cognitive enhancement. The best ""nootropic"" is the ability to develop good habits.",370,5updzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5updzj/a_comprehensive_guide_lsd_and_mdma_for_permanent/,116,1487402169.0,"Cross-posted to r/drugs but I wrote this originally for you guys.

So there has been some interest in LSD after some posts about microdosing, and I have a lot of experience microdosing on and off as well as experience taking full doses of LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA for the sole purpose of self development.

If you haven't already read my previous post, I have an [LSD trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5ajwd6/this_was_the_most_meaningful_experience_of_my/) as well as my MDMA trip report that I [just posted on /r/Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/5utmoj/mdma_might_be_the_greatest_therapeutic_substance/).

Some things to consider. DOSAGE MATTERS. Effects do NOT follow a linear scale. In other words. 25mcg is not ""double"" the feeling of 12.5mcg. Also 50mcg is completely different than 100mcg. You could be jittery on one dose and totally focused on another.

---

**Objectives - LSD**

I've been obsessed with self development, so what drew me to psychedelics was a few things. 

* Psychedelics take your essence and allow you to observe it as though you were looking at yourself from the objective perspective of a completely different human being. You gain an insane hyperawareness into your thoughts and behaviors that would take months to truly understand otherwise. Even if you can logically deduce something for yourself in a sober state, psychedelics helps you ***internalize this logic in a significantly more effective way***.
* Psychedelics increases neurogenesis (see below)
* Psychedelics can help rewire synapses that feel extremely hard wired (ie. people often completely quit smoking the day after. Bad habits are significantly easier to understand and reform after the fact, etc)
* Psychedelics make you better appreciate the world around you, which in turn removes the pressure to perform and thus makes you perform better
* Psychedelics help you reform bad habits and put you on a good track towards developing new habits.

Here is an excerpt that summarizes psychedelic effects on neurogenesis:

>LSD does cause an increase in BDNF, and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. LSD can be described as polyamorious in that is binds to every single seratonin and dopamine receptor. To have a greater affect on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis you really want activation of the three rectptors mentioned earlier. This is where psilocybin enters the conversation. Psilocybin has greater affinity for the three sites mentioned, and the effect of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity is also greater, because of the selectivity of psilocybin. 

So why LSD over Mushrooms even though mushrooms have an arguably greater effect on neurogenesis? The short answer is control. Shrooms are like a magical train ride into the alien depths of your brain. It could be a good time, it could be a bad time, but once you board there's no getting off. A good trip sitter can help adjust the tracks and get you through a ""bad experience"", but you can't really will yourself into a different mindset as easily.

If you really want to get a scientific understanding of LSD and its effects, please read Dr. Fadiman's book. It has tons of objective studies, quantitative data, etc that backs up the aforementioned bullet points. I'm not going to do your homework for you so take what I say with a grain of salt and do your own research if what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you. There are dozens of studies out there.

Now to be clear, the chance of having a bad trip on shrooms with a good trip sitter is more rare than you think, and a lot of people say that their ""bad trips"" were incredibly insightful and ultimately productive nonetheless, but some people can't handle the unknown, so it's important to know yourself. Regardless, you will come out of the other side with new insights and what you do with them is up to you.

*TL;DR:* The objective for me was to better understand my flaws and work to overcome the bottlenecks in my own personality to become a better, more intelligent, and more efficient person in my pursuit of self development.


---

**Objectives - MDMA**

At first I wasn't very interested in MDMA, but after doing it I realized it's absolutely incredible in ways that LSD could NEVER be.

* MDMA works on the parts of your brain that regulate fear, empathy, trust, and openness
* MDMA is in the final stages of FDA approval
* MDMA allows you to take the most traumatizing memories of your life and come to terms with them in ways that would take months or years with traditional therapy alone
* MDMA can help you understand and overcome the paralyzing fears of failure, self-doubt, and personal rigidity

---

**Giving my friends LSD/MDMA in therapeutic sessions**

After experiencing all this myself I truly wanted to share it with everyone I knew. I carefully reached out to friends I knew who had major to minor issues with personality, relationships, etc and took them through my protocol.

* One friend went from smoking 1 pack of cigarettes every 2 days to smoking 1 pack every 2 weeks. If she had a little more self control in general i'm certain she could give it up entirely. She was also able to realize that she was in a toxic relationship and leave her crazy bf after realizing some important things during her trip. She also expressed a new appreciation for nature after walking in the park during her trip.
* Another friend who took 250mcg of LSD told me she suddenly realized that the source of her anger had been her father all along, who had left her and her siblings when she was young. She thought that she had come to terms with this but the LSD made her realize it was still deep within her mind and causing her to be constantly angry. It's been more than a month since her trip and she has expressed that she rarely ever gets angry. She also told me that she sees ""through"" people and has extraordinary insight into manipulative behavior whereas before she would take things at face value. She's been able to register for classes after a long hiatus due to her feeling uncertain about her life. She has a lot more confidence now
* Another friend who had severe self-esteem issues due to his constantly disparaging wife realized his self worth and was able to overcome his paralyzing self-deprecation. He is now studying for a certification to go back to work on a subject he's always been passionate about but too afraid to pursue due to his own mental obstacles.
* My best friend and her husband took MDMA and resolved some of the biggest barriers in their relationship practically overnight. Both of them were able to talk so freely about what was on their mind while simultaneously accepting each other that it literally made all their arguments seem petty and moot. Their relationship is still significantly more open and stronger, 4 wees after the fact. They understand each other better and feel like there's more empathy in the relationship.

Why do I do this? There is nothing more fulfilling to me than seeing people ***reach their fullest potential***. It's a beautiful thing and I love trip sitting.

**Who I am on a microdose**

Microdosing is great because it's subtle enough that no one would notice except you. When I microdose I'm more amped about life, about the task at hand, and have a noticeable improvement in drive and motivation to get shit done. I've realized that I'm more creative; I have better ideas, and my ideas are more fluid and less traditional, I'm appreciably more witty, social, and more of a badass. This is all really subjective but after months of microdosing I am pretty certain I can distinguish the effects that are unique to LSD here. Though I'm typically very introverted and basically glued to my computer at home most of the day, on a microdose I can effortlessly decide to go out, check out events, or decide to do something social that otherwise would take a lot of mental energy.

It's important to know that even on a microdose, *you're still the captain of your own ship and are responsible for the outcome*. It's way easier to have a good time and work towards developing good habits on a microdose, but it's not quick fix where you pop an 1/8th tab and wait for magic to happen. It is merely a catalyst for great things, and microdosing every 3 days will help you build upon smaller successes.

The purpose of microdosing is to put your mind in a ""learning state"" that makes new habits more ""sticky"". And by consistently microdosing and practicing something the stickiness will build up and the habit will remain with you more strongly.

**Permanent Outcomes**

I would dare to say that the human being I am now is incredibly different than who I was 4 months ago when I started everything. I'm significantly more aware, more straightforward with people, daring, open, creative, and I definitely give no effs compared to before. I work and I do what I think I need to do without worrying about the outcome as much. I ***completely*** know who I am now, inside and out. I've come to terms with my weaknesses as a person, accepted them, and am learning how to work around them to get what I want. Other weaknesses I've gotten rid of completely. I know why I used to be avoidant, I know why I treated people certain way, and I know what I need to do to shatter my personal boundaries. I'm still a work in progress but the path is clear now, and I'm excited at the opportunity to challenge myself further.

**Eterneraki's Protocol for getting the best out of LSD & MDMA**

I think it's absolutely imperative to do both eventually. They are like yin and yang. LSD takes a scattered room and helps you gain insight from seemingly unrelated thoughts. MDMA makes you accept the things you've had difficulty accepting and makes you realize that things aren't nearly as big of a deal as you once thought. Just fucking go for it.

If you have anger or anxiety issues I recommend MDMA FIRST. Then a week or 2 later you can do LSD.

Prior to either MDMA or LSD take a week to do the following:

* Practice mindfulness meditation (headspace is a great app) for at least 10 minutes every day
* Take 5-10 minutes every night and write a journal entry. Personal reflections, examine your mood and start thinking about what you want to accomplish during your trip
* Start preparing a list of at least 5 questions you would want to ask yourself during the trip. Some questions may include ""What holds me back from X?"" ""Why is my relationship with this person X?"" ""what do I like about myself?"" ""Why am I afraid/worried/etc about X?"" The more specific the better, but general questions are better than no questions
* Clear out the ENTIRE day that you will be tripping. On the day of, silence your phone and get it out of the way. Your trip sitter should ask you the questions you've prepared right after your peak (~4 hours in).
* Journal the night after your trip as well as the next day or 2 afterwards

MDMA Protocol is 100mg (up to 120 if you're on the heavy side), then 60-75mg 2 hours after the first dose. This is basically the same as the MAPS therapy program. Trip will last 4-6 hours

* Mix the powder in a drink (powder is really bitter, juice is better than water). DO NOT CHUG IT or you will feel nauseous when it all hits you at once. Take sips here and there and finish it over a 3-5 minute span of time. Make sure you eat a light meal 2 hours before. Anything more will either delay onset or reduce effects.

LSD Protocol is 150mcg preferably in the morning (the earlier the better). Trip will last 6-8 hours and you will be tired as fuck. 

In both scenarios it's important to be with someone (SOBER) who cares about you.

AFTERWARDS - This is when the real work begins. Take your new insights and realizations and make a plan to practice being a better you. If you want to microdose take 12.5mcg every third day in the morning. You may do this for 10 weeks straight. Microdosing is safe and very few (if any) adverse events have been noticed by the vast majority of people. Continue reflecting, meditating, and documenting your progress. A support system is tremendously helpful.

**Where to buy - precursor vs actual drug**

/r/darknetmarkets

I personally buy from ""pushing taboo"" (look it up)

precursor lsd as far as I know is just as potent/useful. It's a little more expensive though so I prefer to just buy LSD straight up.

---

**Abuse**

Both can be abused but MDMA is significantly easier to abuse. Newbies can take MDMA again a few weeks after the first, but the recommendation is at least 6 weeks. If you've taken MDMA twice in 2 months, you should wait 3 months before your next roll. 4 times a year thereafter is optimal. Any more than that and you risk falling into the abyss (and it's not fun from what I heard).

LSD is so exhausting that you probably will never want to touch the stuff again, but some people still manage to abuse it. 1 full trip every 6 months is more than enough.

Don't be a fucking idiot.

---

**Safety**

[This graph is a good tl;dr](http://imgur.com/KV6TdKM) 
(Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs)

I'm pretty exhausted from writing all of this out but there are numerous studies on the safety profile of LSD, MDMA, and shrooms. They're completely safe when not abused. Be aware of potential drug interactions if you're on SSRIs or something else.

And before anyone says ""it's just a little adenosine blocking,""... caffeine affects dopamine, serotonin, gaba, cortisol, thyroid, brainwave state, and many other factors, not just adenosine (adenosine has multiple downstream influences, regardless). Also can change sleep architecture which would impact baseline physiology the next day. If you ever look into the effects of caffeine it's a pharmacological rabbithole, and it's not simple. Not to mention all the compounds in coffee (MAOIs?) and/or tea that are confounding variables. Think about it. 

What if that piracetam you took that wasn't that great had something to do with the coffee you drink daily? And if you tried piracetam 'without caffeine,' did you wait a few weeks with no caffeine, or did you just try piracetam during the state of mild caffeine withdrawal and upregulation/resensitization, also not giving you a clear picture of its effects?

Summary:

Antibiotics strong enough to kill off gut bacteria can also stop the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, a section of the brain associated with memory, reports a new study in mice. Researchers also uncovered a clue to why -- a type of white blood cell seems to act as a communicator between the brain, the immune system, and the gut.

So this thread is a bit of a call out, something I normally wouldn't do but feel it needs to be done. The current top thread in this subreddit is someone's reviews of the bunch of nootropics they've done which I think is great, we should all try to share as much info as possible to help others here. 

What is unfortunate though is that this review has mentioned nearly nothing of the cognitive enhancements offered by these substances and instead focused on the depression/anxiety/drug addiction benefits of them. That's not a bad thing to learn about these side benefits but we now have a bunch of people that are self-diagnosing and medicating with nootropics then saying which nootropics are bad because they didn't cure their depression or anxiety, rather than reviewing the nootropic effect of the substances. 

These people then take double, triple or ten times the recommended dose trying to get results, stacking multiple nootropics at a time and then creating shitpost after shitpost, all getting deleted, until eventually they've reviewed 33 substances in about 3 months time. 

I remembered seeing this account post months ago and having their posts deleted multiple times from mods because they had just jumped into taking shit tons of Ashwagandha and complaining it didn't treat their depression and was unsafe for people or how they were feeling unwell because of taking multiple nootropics. They were posting about a new nootropic they were on nearly every day with no benefits and a bunch of sides, eyes twitching, mood swings etc.

Because they only mentioned 1 of 33 substances offered cognitive benefits I asked them provide some more info about the nootropic effects of their reviews:

>Dude, you have no idea what a nootropic even is. It's just an unregulated substance with a benefit to the brain. You don't understand how any of this works. 

This individual came to nootropics after a kratom addiction (congratulations beating that by the way) and has since done about 5+ years of nootropics testing in the space of 3 months in attempts to cure depression/anxiety. They might have some useful experiences to share but this is an extremely dangerous strategy that doesn't properly test the effectiveness of any one substance, essentially averaging about 3 days each substance and spending the whole time comparing them to stimulants. 

I guess the purpose of my post here is to make sure you understand what the purpose of a nootropic is (cognitive enhancement not anti-depressant, anxiety cure although some may help) and that you shouldn't trust reviews just because someone has done a lot of nootropics, instead looking at the quality of their testing parameters.",2020-03-31 03:18:42

"Things that made a noticeable difference to my ADHD, mood and emotional behaviour - feeling better!",340,dfgeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dfgeep/things_that_made_a_noticeable_difference_to_my/,118,1570653349.0,"# I created this post to inform others of my own experiences over the past 10 years of struggling with ADHD symptoms and how I manage without taking ADHD prescription medicines.

**This is NOT medical or dietary advice, it is my own personal experience. Everyone is different and you may react differently to me - do your own research and seek professional medical advice before embarking on any dietary changes or supplement use.**

So, over the years I have done much experimentation or happened upon foods, supplements and medications that have had noticeable effect on my ADHD symptoms, moods and emotional behavior.

**Caffeine:** Plays absolute havoc with my moods, real shame because I love coffee and the feeling it gives initially is awesome for me but overall this is my nightmare. I've drank tea and coffee since about 10 years old, but it took me another 25 years to discover its detrimental effects on me. 20 minutes in, after consumption, I'm buzzing (usually from coffee), have great energy, great mood, chatty as hell, can be funny as F! and feel euphoric. 2-3 of hours later the effects subside and I feel subdued, sometimes twitchy. If I have another caffeine hit at this point it's not the same intensity as the first and then here is the real kicker: \~24 hours later I'd often get migraines, horrible irritability, become impatient and snappy and overall feeling out of sorts for hours. Where I'd had multiple caffeine hits throughout the previous day this would ensure that the negative symptoms continued longer into the next day feeling out of control. I went decaf about 7 years ago - never really looked back - I still get some benefits without the caffeine! It was a MAJOR significance to eliminating some of my ADHD symptoms (impulsive, overly chatty, erratic behaviour, etc.) . Very occasionally, when I go on a night out, I might have a Red Bull and Vodka and can really be the life of the party at the time, but the next day or after my mood is rarely good!

**Gluten/Wheat:** 6 years ago I started an elimination diet - I basically lived on rice & peas and drank water for about a month. First 3-5 days it was hellish; headaches would pain me terribly, but after I noticed a ***significant*** positive in my mood and my energy levels. Whereas before I would struggle to wake up in the mornings, hit fatigue each day around the afternoon and have brain fog throughout the day, I now felt amazing and had none of these symptoms. It was like a cloud had cleared in my head, I was no longer tired and was able to think clearly. I was peeing more often too, like every two hours to begin with because wheat/gluten retains water. I introduced different foods over the next few weeks and noticed that whenever I ate wheat based products the fatigue and brain fog would return and this would affect me for days after. I'm not Celiac or diagnosed as gluten intolerant (I have no other negative side effects with gluten). I've been gluten free since then and this has been important in helping me manage my ADHD symptoms.

**Sugar:** I cut this out when I went Gluten free - an overall positive when reduced.  I can tell when I've had too much but I'm a real sucker with a sweet tooth!

**Zinc (Gluconate) 40mg:** When I notice that I'm beginning to procrastinate and become less motivated to start tasks I take a Zinc supplement. I don't really notice any difference the first day but after about 18-24 hours I'm back on it. I wake up feeling more motivated to start tasks, a little less impulsive and more intent in my focus. I actually stumbled across this discovery by accident some 15 years ago (before I knew my symptoms correlated with ADHD) while battling a lifetime of large reoccurring and painful canker sores/mouth ulcers. It stopped them and at the time I noticed some positive changes in my energy/motivation. It wasn't for another 8 years or so that I realised the significance that Zinc had on alleviating my ADHD symptoms. I don't supplement zinc on a daily basis - only when I feel the need.

**Vitamin D3 (5000 ui):** Imagine being out in the lovely sunshine all day, getting a slight tan, and by bedtime you hit the pillow feeling good, fall asleep and sleep soundly then wake up feeling fresh and early the next day. That's what Vitamin D3 does for me. Doesn't seem to have any effect on my moods or focus, just seems to make me feel fresher, brighter - better. I supplement more in the winter (during the shorter/darker days) but only for a few weeks at a time.

**L-Tyrosine 500mg:** L-Tyrosine is another positive for me - within 30 minutes of taking it I feel the effects of being more on track and focused. This amino acid has been great for me when I know I will need to focus and get things done - like a work project. A side effect I have found is that my sleep tends to be better and I dream a lot more. I don't supplement daily - only when I feel the need and sometimes suffer headaches from it if taken for too many days.

**Magnesium (complex) 400mg:** It has a minimal effect on my moods - maybe slightly calming. I sometimes take it to chill me out before bed to aid my sleep. It has the side effect of making me poop more. I don't supplement daily - only when I feel the need.

**5-HTP (100mg):** Has a big effect on my sleep - I hit the pillow and fall asleep pretty quick if taken a few hours before bed. It gives me the best/craziest dreams. I definitely feel something good with this, it's not negative for me but I cannot quite put my finger on it. Overall it has a positive outcome on my mood. I rarely take this supplement though due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and usually only take it to balance out the dopamine if taking L-Tyrosine.

**Cetirizine Hydrochloride/ZIRTEK (Hayfever/Allergy relief):** Here's an odd discovery I made. I've always suffered with cat and hayfever allergies and sometimes take Cetirizine to combat them. Within a couple of hours of taking (I only take half a tablet/5mg) it makes me tired and I'll sleep right through the night (ZONKED!)  - the next morning i'm feeling slightly groggy (that's the downside) but then something strange/special happens, 12-24 after taking. I get this no-nonsense attitude and feeling of focused, become quite assertive and won't tolerate pettiness, but not in an aggressive manner. To sum up how I feel on this would be: ***""I know what needs to be done and this is how it's best to do it. Get to your point please. Come on, lets start and get on with the task!""***. I love the feeling I get from this the day after taking it. I don't like to take this to control my mood though as there are some not great documented side effects/reports that I'm not comfortable with. I don't supplement this often - only when REALLY needed.

**Food Colourings**

**Brilliant Blue (E133)** **~~& Sunset Yellow (Tartrazine E102)~~****:**

Okay, I avoid these two like the plague. Banned and previously banned in some European countries respectively. If I consume ~~either of these~~ E133 (Brilliant Blue) I start glowing, bounce off the walls and need to run around in circles within 15 minutes of consumption. It's not good that an additive, used in kid targeted foods, has this kind of effect in my opinion. The  warnings are there to be found for these two on the internet.

I am writing to you to express my opposition to HR 2851, the SITSA Act. As a lifelong (insert state here), I embrace a healthy and active lifestyle like many of our neighbors. I have followed the news in recent years as there has been a substantial increase in overdose deaths across our country - half of these deaths each year are attributed to illicit substances, with fentanyl and fentanyl analogues contributing to a larger percent of the share year over year. Legal pharmaceutical drugs account for approximately half of these overdose deaths each year.

Further legislation regarding fentanyl is redundant, as legislation has already accomplished what the SITSA Act is intended for. The Federal Analogue Act passed in 1986 gave authority to prosecutors to treat synthetic analogues the same as the drugs they resemble. In November 2017, the DEA passed emergency scheduling for all fentanyl analogues.

I believe the SITSA Act is an unnecessary overreach by our government. It consolidates all scheduling powers with our Attorney General - without consulting physicians, scientists, or public health experts. With this act, scheduling of a substance would become a subjective rather than an objective process. Harmless, legal supplements that people use everyday for health and wellness can be included under the scope of having similar effects to illicit substances, not based on chemical structure, pharmacology, dependence, or physiological effects on the body. If the goal is to enforce criminal penalties against fentanyl analogues, prosecutors already have the necessary tools to prosecute fentanyl analogues.

Please vote no HR 2851!

Thank you for your time.

Do any of you think we’re just spinning in circles?,318,dlqj7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dlqj7q/do_any_of_you_think_were_just_spinning_in_circles/,153,1571815795.0,"I just want to be real here. I’ve been using different supps/noots for years, browsing this sub for years, spending thousands and thousands of dollars (as a guy in his 20’s nonetheless). It seems like a lot of us are trying to self medicate. For me, depression and anxiety is what I’m trying to conquer and I turned to supps and noots for that. Years of my time and money to find mild temporary relief. 

I constantly see different hypothesis being posted here. NAC breaking down the BBB, Nitric Oxide being neurotoxic, and countless more. Every single day it’s something new. It’s great to be curious and question things but there’s so much wild speculation here that I feel like it’s easy to walk away with wrong information. 

I understand there’s people here with conditions like TBI that may or may not actually see some benefit but I can’t help but feel the vast majority of us are just spinning our wheels and getting caught in this cycle of different substances. I can’t help but feel many of us are self medicating and looking for a cure that doesn’t exist here but we still come because maybe we’ll finally find that one thing to fix us.

I know this isn’t everyone. I understand there’s a lot of really knowledge people here but as much as it sucks to hear, sometimes the most effective things are the basics we hate to hear about. Sometimes the basics aren’t enough but how much are we really doing for ourselves here? Are throwing these different substances into our bodies doing more harm than good?

"The idiots guide to /r/nootropics (Too long, so extra post in the comments)",320,2yd2p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2yd2p5/the_idiots_guide_to_rnootropics_too_long_so_extra/,52,1425871780.0,"Hey!

Welcome to /r/nootropics, a subreddit that focuses on enhancing the brain through different methods (pills, exercise, meditation, anything). We'll hopefully be able to help you with your problems and get the extra edge you're most likely looking for. 

So first some background, it all started with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea 40-50 years ago (it didn't really, but the history is easier this way). In the 60's Dr. Giurgea first synthesised piracetam, the now well known drug. For almost a decade he must have thought ""Hmm, how can I become more famous, make up a new word and start a new class of drugs?"" and then it finally hit him! If he made up a new word, added some criterias and then published it, he had it all figured out! So in 1972 he published a study that first used the word nootropic (which means to bend the mind) and decided on some criterias. The criterias are:

1.    They should enhance learning and memory.
2.    They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
3.    They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine).
4.    They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5.    They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

To make it easier for you, most people don't use this definition, ""nootropics"" is commonly used as ""cognitive enhancers"" (which might be neurotoxic, have serious sides, etc). I would like for everyone to stop doing this, but it will obviously not happen but please try. 

The real history goes way back. Humans have always been trying to improve their wetware, Ayurvedic, Shamanism, Chinese, Korean, Siddha, Tibetian, etc have all had herbs and the like to enhance cognition in some ways. That's all I'll say, I know way too little about it. 

You've now decided to start on your noot (short for nootropic) and improvement journey, great! We're glad to have you! But first of all I want to give you realistic expectations. Most noots will not be super noticable or enhance any brain function by a lot, we're just not there yet. Some drugs that seem insanly good in animal models do not transfer to humans at all. Then we have the problem with noots that you do not feel, but still ""works"" (an example for me would be [LLLT](http://www.gwern.net/LLLT)). But as always, people do not respond identically to drugs, you need to try things to know for sure. If you want to feel something you will most likely need to try stimulants or potentially an anxiolytic if you've got anxiety. Also be cautious of interactions, search and read lots before you add new things.

So now that you realise that noots aren't anything like NZT-48 in the movie Limitless we can move on. 


Before you start supplementing things you should get your lifestyle in order. The first thing you should take care of is your sleep. Try to get your +-8 hours and enhance the quality. When you got that in order you should start exercising, both cardiovascular (which got a lot proof for being a cognitive enhancer) and strength (not as much evidence, but more is coming). Try to be active during the day (try not to sit all day, exercise for one hour and think you're good), it'll help sleep and everything in your life. When you're done with those two things you have a good foundation, but adding meditation will help even more. It'll help with any anxiety you have, make you happier and a lot more (cognitive enhancing things). If you don't want to try meditation for some reason, look into neurofeedback. If you do not know how to fix these things, check /r/fitness, /r/meditation and /r/sleep, just check our sidebar relevant subreddits. 

When you got that fixed you could look into your diet. This part is super controversial due to different schools of thought. First we have the more mainstream, low GI-carbs, lots of ""good"" fats, lowish saturated, etc. But we also got a bit of the opposite (/r/keto), low carb, high fat (any except for transfats), etc. This forces the body to go into ketosis (your cells run on more ketones (except for a few cells)) which might hold some benefit for different populations. There's some research hinting towards being in ketosis might be good if you have blood sugar issues (which might cause alzheimer's later in life and cell damage all through), but to me, it does not seem to hold more promise than that. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but you need to make up your own mind and do what you want and find practical. Something almost everyone seems to agree on is that veggies and fruits (ketoers does not like the last one as much as veggies), this is backed up by a lot of research. This is due to multiple things, one of which is that veggies and fruits contain a lot of polyphenols with unique effects. Broccoli has been shown to reduce the effects of (some aspects of) autism, blueberries have shown to fight alzheimer's, etc. 

There's also a bunch of supplements that are usually not seen as noots but still have positive effects. The first group would be vitamins. There are a few that most people are deficent in, mainly vitamin K and D. Vitamin K (in the form of K1) is usually just found in leafy greens and K2 (which we usually prefer to supplement) in a few fermented foods. The health effects are quite important for preventing cardiovascular, bone and potentially neurological problems. Vitamin D has in recent years been promoted as the cure all, which it's obviously not. It is however very good for you. There are a lot of correlations between auto-immune diseases and higher mortality in vitamin D deficent people. Adding 2000-5000 IU of D3 daily (and keeping your blood levels checked) should fix the deficency for most people. 

If we move within the group micronutrients, but don't look at vitamins, we find minerals. The most significant in this category (relevant to us) is magnesium. To describe it in simple terms, it helps you calm down, promotes synaptic plasticity, help depression, long-term memory and a gazallion other things related to enzymes. If you take it before sleep you'll get better sleep quality and fall asleep faster. There are however forms that have been shown to be fairly worthless, mainly magnesium oxide. You will have to look up what form you want to supplement with. Just be sure to not take too high doses, it might act as a laxative!

Another mineral worth checking out is zinc. Deficency might lower testosterone and BDNF levels, both which are highly correlated with depression and cognitive functions. Doing too much might have opposite effects on BDNF levels and be toxic, so try to not overdo it. A normal starting dose would be around 15-25 mg, adding copper at other times might also be worth looking into. 

If we leave the micronutrients and look into other supplements that are worth looking into, we quickly find creatine. /u/silverhydra calls it a pseudovitamin (because real defiency results in retardation) which means we must look into it! Creatine is a molecule with a phosphate group bound to itself, if you remember your high school biology you'll remember that ATP becomes ADP and needs a new phosphate group to become ATP again. Guess where you can get that group from? Exactly, creatine! When your cells use up ATP your creatine phosphate donates its group and regenerates ATP. This has been found to be extra effective for vegetarians who consume small quantities of creatine. They are one of the few groups that actually might get an IQ increase from adding it! Other groups that would benefit from it would be elders, sleep deprived and potentially everyone else. It's neuroprotective, might raise your IQ, might make you live longer, modulates a billion things, there's really no reason not to take it. 

You've probably browsed multiple sites for starting your stack and then found /r/nootropics, so you want us to help you get started. Sure can do! There are four beginner stacks usually mentioned, the caffeine + theanine, noopept, bacopa and the piracetam (+ choline).

But something important before you order ANYTHING, get a damn milligram scale! As you're most likely not doing anything that requires exact measurements, something cheap like Gemini-20  will work. It will run you about $20 and will last you a very long time. This is for your own safety only (and I know you'll get hate/no help if you create a thread asking about what 200 mg looks like in powder form). Be also cautious with what source you use. Scammers pop up all the time in the noot world, some selling things that have caused hospitalisation. Check the sidebar for suppliers that are trusted, a guideline is to mainly buy from sellers than can provide third part CoAs (Certificate of Analysis). 

Have you heard about theanine before? If you have, it has probably been in the context of tea. If you have not, theanine is an amino acid analogue that we mainly find in tea. Why are we adding it to our lovely caffeine? Theanine seems to induce a state of calm, but still keep you alert/awake. Adding caffeine to it boosts the alert/awake, thus making the caffeine nicer for you. There are multiple studies on the combo with positive results (and on the individual compounds). If you're already drinking coffee you can pour some theanine in your cup and enjoy it more. The commonly recommended ratio between theanine and caffeine is 2:1 T:C. But be sure to play around with the ratio to see what works best for you. A good starting dose would be 50-100 mg caffeine and 100-200 mg theanine. 


Maybe you don't want to use caffeine, you want to expand your stack or have some other reason to add other things. Then you might want to start with piracetam and choline.  This stack has less scientific, but a fair amount of anecdotal evidence (if you care about that). Piracetam was first synthesised by Dr. Giurgea and his team and had some success. The mechanism is not fully understod yet (as with many other drugs) and some argue it's mainly good for the older population, fighting off the age related decline in brain function. The choline is added because one of the mechanisms seems to be cholinergic (the scientific evidence for adding it is weak, anecdotal is not as weak, but still not that strong). When you're adding choline you should be mind the dose. Too high dosages seem to induce depression in a lot of people. The dosage here is a bit more spread between users. Piracetam is taken in doses between 800-4800 mg, 1-3 times a day and choline is taken at doses around 200-1000 mg depending on form. You should however not buy any form of choline, there are better and worse sources. The worst source is choline bitartrate, which should be the last waw out (get some other form if you can). The better forms are Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline. You should try with and without choline to make sure how you respond to them. Try adding them one at a time, as you should with any supplement. 

Maybe you don't like the former ones, maybe want to try new things or maybe have some interest Russian drugs. Then you might be interested in noopept, a dipeptide. The evidence is even less for noopept, basically zero in humans in the western world. The mechanism for this one is even less researched. The doses for this compound is 5-30 mg 1-3x daily, orally or sublingual. Too high doses seem to impair working memory for some people, so it's best to start low. One of the creators have been interview by Smart Drug Smarts which you can listen to [here](http://smartdrugsmarts.com/rita-ostrovskaya-noopept/). 

Maybe you're one of those people who prefer to take ""natural"" things, then we have a herb for you! The herb I'm talking about is the adaptogenic herb Bacopa Monnieri. Bacopa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for many years, but as with the other drugs, the mechanism is still not fully understod. The dose used is usually 300-500 mg if it's 50% bacosides. Don't get sad if you don't notice any effects right away, it takes time for it to work. Most trials with good results take it for weeks, it's usually recommended to be taken for atleast 8 weeks, then people usually start noticing it. 

There are lots of pre-made stacks, but almost all of them have the same problem, under dosed/don't tell the dose, over priced and no proof that the things they use are pure. So research A LOT before buying them.


As I've written before, there are non-supplemental ways to enhance your cognition. Remember the thing I talked about when I said it was important to measure things? It was LLLT, also called Low-Level Laser/LED/Light Therapy. It sounds like something a hippie made up, but there is a lot of evidence behind it. LLLT works by using a light source (in the 600-1000 nm range) and shining it where you want (in my case the skull (for the brain)). The photons are absorbed by cytochrome C which increases its activity and thus increase ATP production. It does a whole lot more related to it and has been shown to improve reaction time, improve memory, etc. For more info you should search this subreddit and get over to lostfalco's thread on longecity. Another thing that is a bit more risk would be tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation. Exactly how and how good it works is fairly unknown, but preliminary data hints at some great results. If you want a high quality unit you will need to spend a few hundred bucks, if you can build one you'll save a lot. There's really no way to explain this without going overboard (placement, intensity, hormones and a lot of other things plays a role in the effect), so head over to /r/tDCS if you're interested. 

There are also other ways that just requires your computer, so called brain games! The current brain game that has most evidence is n-back. To keep it short a few studies has shown that it increases working memory and potentially IQ (which is disputed), it's one of the few games that have evidence behind it. The most common form is dual-n-back, where you are keeping track of a sound and a position. If you want to learn more, /u/gwern has by far the best papers on it which you can read [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) and [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis).

This is also a good way to keep measuring how effective some of your noots are. Other brain games have not shown as much potential, but can be a way to measure progress. Sites that offers these are [Luminosity](http://www.lumosity.com/ ) (Paid) and [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ ) (Free), simple apps for reaction time are also worth looking at.

Liver Injury due to Ashwagandha.

&#x200B;

From the text:

Two patients were taking ashwagandha to decrease anxiety, one to counteract stress, one to increase concentration and one for increased energy and vitality. In the three cases from Iceland the patients were taking ashwagandha supplements from the same manufacturer (NOW® Ashwagandha) although one patient was also using another supplement that contained ashwagandha (Infowarslife® Super Male Vitality). In these three cases from Iceland the daily dose varied from 450 to 1350 mg. The implicated product was available for one of the US cases: Nature's Way®, Standardized Ashwagandha, containing 500 mg of ashwagandha Chemical analysis confirmed the presence of ashwagandha in all supplements, and no other known toxic compounds or trace metals were found. No patient was taking other potentially hepatotoxic prescription medications, although four were consuming one or more other supplements: Super Male Vitality, Spirulina, Chlorella, Rhodiola and Cerenity.

&#x200B;

It is only 5 cases, but I think it is still interesting to know just to be cautious. All of them were taking the whole extract, I wonder if KSM 66 has the same potential to cause liver toxicity.",2020-01-30 23:38:09

"A follow-up to ""Incredibly simple ADHD ""stack"". If you have ""cyclical"" ADHD symptoms, this could be the reason why""",310,aojy6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/aojy6q/a_followup_to_incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you/,89,1549682062.0,"A month ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/) in this community, and it got quite a lot more attention than I ever thought it could. Well, now things are different. I've finally reached a conclusion regarding those ""supplements"".

The previous post contained a lot of research that took a long time to pull together. This one isn't quite as rigorous, but I am very confident in my solution.

**tldr;** Those supplements we're treating a symptom, rather than the source of the problem. I'm now on a Keto diet, I eat many eggs for choline, I take alpha GPC, and Theacrine **(new, not fully tested yet)**. I take about 2700mg of EPA and DHA combined per day. I don't think I've ever felt this sharp and energetic while being stable.

# Since then:

I didn't want to keep taking a bunch of B vitamins. The regime continued to work, but it didn't feel right. I stopped taking them and continued to experiment. I wanted to find something simple. Since then, things that I tried which had an effect:

**Glutamine** \- Strong energetic rush, stopped working after a while. Eventually made me feel worse.

**Betaine HCL** \- Really helped me feel awake. I began to consider that my energy levels were due to digestion issues

**TMG (Betaine Anhydrous)** \- Strong effect for a while, but tapered off.

The fact that Betaine HCL was so helpful pointed me towards digestion issues. ^(I also noticed that my stool was pale) \- a lack of bile production? Bile is produced in the liver. This finally pointed me in the right direction.

# The problem:

I suspect that the issues I was facing are two things. 1. **Insulin resistance**. 2. **Choline deficiency**.

Since discovering the TMG (Trimethylglycine) helped, I learned about tetra-methylglycine. Also known as Choline. Choline is incredibly important for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is very important for focus. But not only that, it's a methyl donor. Many people in this community know about this but I was completely blind to it. **I was barely getting any choline in my diet**.

[Oregon state university has my favorite information page about choline.](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline) Here's a relevant quote:

>Men and women fed intravenously (IV) with solutions that contained adequate methionine and folate but lacked choline have been found to develop a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

And then later in that same section:

>The occurrence of NAFLD is usually associated with the co-presentation of metabolic disorders, including obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension, in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

At the same time, I realized that I felt my worst when eating carbs. Not just wheat, but rice as well. One night I ate a bunch of spaghetti and felt terrible for 3 days straight. I now realize that the symptoms I listed in the previous post are likely hypoglycemic episodes.

# The theory:

I had been on a vegan diet for a while, which (unless you're careful) makes it difficult to get your daily choline content. Choline is most easily obtained from meat products. Oregon state university's choline information page states the following:

>The recommended adequate intake (AI) of choline is set at 425 milligrams (mg)/day for women and 550 mg/day for men.

The B vitamins I had been taking earlier helped with methylation, which can reduce an individual's required choline intake. Choline is also used for methylation, meaning that I likely had more choline available to turn into acetylcholine.

Furthermore, the lack of choline likely caused-or worsened insulin resistance. This would explain why I could no longer eat carbs.

# The solution:

I adopted a ketogenic diet to deal with the insulin resistance, and within a week I felt amazing. There is a lot of science behind the keto diet and its effect on insulin, too much to get into here. If anyone is interested, I can link you to my favorite resources. This, **by far**, had the greatest effect.

I also eat 4 eggs a day to reach my daily choline content. Eggs are very keto-friendly and contain the most choline out of any food. But since this is r/Nootropics, I also found some success in pills.

# Nootropics:

* **Alpha-GPC:** Since I knew of the importance of choline, I looked into choline supplementation. I finally decided on some Alpha GPC and Uridine (made me feel worse), to increase Acetylcholine synthesis. [The nicotinic cholinergic system has a promise in the treatment of ADHD, and plays a big role in focus.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4487649/) It had a really positive effect.
* **Theacrine:** This is a new one, and not much information is available for it. I've been taking it for a few days, and I really like the effect. It goes really well with the Alpha-GPC. Long-term results are pending. **(warning, I bought this because of the hype. If it doesn't have the tolerance issues that caffeine has, it's well worth it for me. It's also a bit smoother than caffeine.)**
* **Omega-3s:** Standard thing to do, but I take high amounts of it. About 2700mg of EPA&DHA. This doesn't have any directly noticeable effects, but I do believe it's helping.
* **L-theanine:** At night, very helpful before sleeping.

There were quite a few of you who said that ""this is me"". If you experienced [any of these symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a6it4n/incredibly_simple_adhd_stack_if_you_have_cyclical/), pay attention to how you react to carbs. Metabolic disorders in North America are on the rise, and that is often attributed to the ""Standard American Diet"". Hope you find the solutions you are looking for. Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones. Cheers.",2019-02-09 08:44:22
"Update: Guide to Healing Your Gut - Thoughts, Dietary Suggestions, Supplemental Alternatives, and Depression.",312,63bqj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/63bqj7/update_guide_to_healing_your_gut_thoughts_dietary/,95,1491305145.0,"Hey again. [After reading through the comments on my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/630czc/guide_to_healing_your_gut/), I got the impression that a lot of you thought the supplement regimen was too much and didn't like the idea of pounding a bunch of capsules every few hours(which I totally understand, but sometimes depression, anxiety, and IBS can make you desperate enough to do so). My intention with the post was to help people who need an overall solution to an incredibly stubborn problem, and attack it from all angles. While it might seem like overkill to some folks, I think we forget how persistent and relentless an IBS problem can be, and I believe its primarily due to the gut mucosal layer and intestinal microvillus not being there to keep the flora intact, typically as a result of bad diet. While I still think there quite a bit value in taking all these supplements together, I don’t think it is required for long term use if you eat properly after starting it. Once you get the gut back to being completely healthy and diverse with the proper flora, it goes back to what it was like when you were a kid; eating a poptart and a pepsi for breakfast everyday and shitting just fine. Not saying you should do that, but having good gut health allows you to have some fun sometimes and not worry the next day. That’s a really valuable thing, at least it is for me. 

**Probiotics**

One of the primary reasons why I suggested the GOL(34 Strain 100+ billion CFU) probiotic was because of the amount of strain variety you get. While there may be negligible amounts of some of the latter strains, with the proper prebiotic fiber, they can still flourish and populate your gut effectively with many different cognitively beneficial strains of bacteria that aren't as available in food(not to mention how gross some fermented food is). With Probotic drinks or foods, you often don't get as much variety and nor do you get the exact details of which strains are populated within. Kefir tends to produce a lot of the Lactobacillus strains that can exacerbate histamine issues, and thus allergies/inflammation. Kombucha's bacteria profile has some bad strains like Candida which can often make high sugar/fructose diet floras much worse, as candida loves it sugar... In its entirety, its great stuff that everyone should be drinking IN ADDITION to probiotic supplementation (but not at the exact same time - probiotic in the morning/kombucha at night). Considering that, it's incredibly hard to get a diverse microflora when just relying on food. You'd need to consume all kinds of things such as Kefir, Natto, Kimchi, Sauerkraut, Kombucha, Greek Yogurt, and a handful of others. Personally, I'd rather just take a high strain/CFU probiotic daily and consume those other probiotics sources a few times a week. We want to cover all the bases right? Flora diversity, intestinal mucosa, and microvillus health are all dependent on each other – we need gut homeostasis and equilibrium if we want the cognitive benefits too. 

**Intestinal and Mental Health**

As some of you may know, the ""leaky gut"" label has gotten a bit of criticism as of late for its overuse with Naturopaths and other pseudoscience based health advisers. While I still think there is a massive amount of research to be done to confirm its validity, it's safe to say that there are strong correlations between gutflora/intestinal health and all kinds of life debilitating neurological disorders. This is an emerging science that I believe is on the brink of changing how we look at healthcare. There is a second brain in our body, and what you feed that brain has profound effects on your overall health and equally your perception of reality. What happened to the old saying ""you are what you eat""? If you consume a diet that is high in fat and sugar, your stomach bacteria will be fundamentally different than someone who is on a vegan diet. If you were to take two identical twins from the same starting age and feed one a high sugar/carb diet with little fiber and the other a perfect Paleo/Mediterranean diet high in fiber and good fats, they would turn out to be two fundamentally different people cognitively and behaviorally. I could almost guarantee that the kid with the high carb processed diet would turn out with less mental acuity, emotional intelligence, and overall health. He’d probably get an ADHD diagnosis early, and may even exhibit symptoms on the autistic spectrum before he hits puberty. What if this is entirely implicated by your gut bacteria and diet? What if the antibiotics that he took when he was 10 permanently destroyed a strain of bacteria in his gut that was benefiting him cognitively, and he was never the same after? I dunno about some of you, but I fell into a deep depression coincidentally after I had done a couple years of antibiotics and I’m still slowly getting my shit together. If gut bacteria and intestinal health are important enough to effect neurotransmitter levels, BDNF production, neurogenesis, and other beneficial cognitive functions, then shouldn’t our goal be to have a healthy flora above all else?

The more I read about this, the more I feel like we have been misled and unjustly coerced into an unhappy life through the diets forced on us via advertising and grocery store isles. If you look at how food affects you neurologically, then it’s safe to say that the typical American diet is probably one of the “most addicting”. Sugar is addicting, period. It light’s your brain up the exact same way that cocaine does and while it doesn’t have the same systemic addictive effects, you certainly have withdrawals if you cut a 500g a day sugar habit to 0. Same goes for fatty or unhealthy processed food. The goal of any bacteria is to grow and populate. It’s in the gut bacteria’s evolutionary best interest to continue pumping out feel good neurotransmitters that your brain likes, so your brain will associate that food with positive emotions and try to maintain the cycle. Does it suffice to say that your second brain might have some control over you?  





**Dietary Suggestions and Supplemental Alternatives**

Everyone should already be taking magnesium, vitamin D, and digestive enzymes. You can’t get NAG from diet, so this is only thing I'd recommend supplementing. If you want the maximum benefits, then please eat right while introducing these strains of bacteria into your gut. Taking probiotics with a bad diet isn’t a good idea in my opinion. You risk the chance of developing worse problems if one of the “good strains” gets out of whack too and wreaks havoc on your immune system or inflammatory process. Paleo/Mediterranean diet is what I’d recommend following being that keto can be a tad low on fiber. You want lots of diverse plant fibers from fruit, vegetables, and nuts - as well as the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects produced with green leafy vegetables.

**Final Notes**

I know this seems like a lot of work, and for those of you who have severe anxiety or depression, I understand wholeheartedly how hard keeping up with this shit is. I’ve been through several cycles of diets, nootropics, addictions, and exercise phases, and I was never able to maintain it. I would always relapse to bad habits out of need for immediate comfort. That’s the bitch about depression and anxiety. You know what you need to do and you know what steps are required to make your life better, but you just can’t find the mental motivation to do it. I believe discipline is a muscle of consciousness and if you don’t exercise daily, it atrophies. If there is one nootropic that helps exercise this discipline muscle and maintain good habits, it’d be P21(with meditation). I’ve taken it on/off for just over a month now, and its effects on my mental willpower have been completely unmatched. I no longer sit and ruminate with procrastinating anxiety about all the shit I needed to do, I just fucking do it now because I know I’m investing in my future happiness and it'll be worth it long term(as cheesy as that sounds). Being content used to be my only goal in life, and now I realize how pointless that is. You need goals and struggle to reach those truly rewarding happy moments, everything can't be great all the time. So take 2 weeks and plan out every meal, supplement, meditation session, and exercise routine and follow it precisely. Just know that while you feel shitty and anxiety ridden right now, I can almost guarantee at the end of the 2 week mark you’ll feel better than you ever have and you'll want to continue some of the habits you've learned. If you fall back into depression, so be it, just learn something while you try to claw your way back out again. Eventually it'll come together. :)

/u/Guacamolium,311,2lb1dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2lb1dp/uguacamolium/,139,1415168953.0,"Unfortunately, I have some bad news. Jason (/u/Guacamolium), my business partner and co-founder of Ceretropic has died. He was found dead in his apartment on Friday afternoon. He had not come in for a few days, and was not answering his phone. I got a little worried, so /u/Synzael and I decided to go check on him. After he did not answer, we decided to get the police to come down. When they entered his apartment, they found him dead inside.

The toxicology screen will not be back for a few weeks. However, Jason had been having a few problems with Xanax and drinking. He was never one to be careful with his own safety, and would often have horrible insomnia. This led to him turning to Xanax and alcohol to try and get a little bit of sleep some nights. I let him know how irresponsible that was, but he never really got the message. There were a few occasions that I found him passed out after taking too much. I made him get into a substance abuse program, which he had been going to regularly. However, I never felt he was taking it seriously enough. I had hoped that he had things under control, but always feared that something would happen. I just figured it would be him getting in trouble, or driving on it and getting in an accident. I never expected the worst.

I know a lot of you spoke to Jason often about all manner of things. He was a very intelligent person, with a lot of great ideas. This is a big loss for Ceretropic, and the community as a whole. We would always have long sessions, where we would bounce new ideas off each other. Our personalities worked very well together for coming up with new compounds. He would always be sort of out there with optimism, and I would bring a healthy level of pragmatism to the equation; which led to a good creative environment. It's going to be very different without him around.

Anyone out there that has someone they know that is going through a tough time, please take the time to try and help them. **People in general, but especially us in the nootropic community, like to see ourselves as invincible. We never consider the possibility that one wrong measurement could be the end of us. I think this should be a wake up call for many of us out there being a little too cavalier with our safety. You never know what moment could be your last.** I wish I could have been a better friend to Jason, and possibly helped prevent this from happening. However, I know that hindsight is always 20/20. I hope that this incident can help us all to strive to be more careful with our safety, and reach out to those that we know need a little help. Jason was a very good guy, and he will be missed.

Ceretropic will continue to operate as normally as we can. Please bear with us for any delays in the coming weeks. ",2014-11-05 11:59:13
Theacrine - Not a mere Caffeine substitute,311,bdnsro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bdnsro/theacrine_not_a_mere_caffeine_substitute/,50,1555405341.0,"Theacrine, also known as 1,3,7,9-Methyluric Acid is a real buzz compound on r/nootropics. However, very little is yet known about Theacrine and few studies have been made. Many claims are made with few sources - in this post I will summarize studies on Theacrine to possibly elucidate some of its properties.

When searched for on Pubmed, Theacrine returns 25 results. A significant amount of these are regarding chemical reactions or plant synthesis routes. These will be ignored, as they are irrelevant.

Theacrine has locomotor-activating effects in rodent models, primarily through binding to Adenosine receptors. The study does however suggest that Theacrine might be directly acting through Dopamine receptors, as D1 and D2 antagonists block the increase in locomotion.^[1]

This is however misleading as not only do D1 and D2 antagonists decrease locomotion all on their own, blocking these receptors has also been shown to prevent locomotor activation in Caffeine-treated rats.^[2]

Indeed, Caffeine and other A1 antagonists have been shown to induce Dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens.^[3]

Thus while it cannot be completely ruled out that Theacrine binds to Dopamine receptors directly, it is exceedingly unlikely. The study, in proper context, suggests that Theacrine is solely an Adenosine receptor antagonist. This also seems to be the most logical conclusion to draw as of now.

Theacrine also exerts antagonistic effects in combination with Caffeine, several studies confirm that Theacrine potentiates Pentobarbital-induced sleep, as opposed to Caffeine which attenuates it.^[4][5]

In fact, Theacrine alone attenuates Caffeine-induced insomnia in rats and increases Adenosine content in the hippocampus of rats. Even further, Theacrine significantly reverses the decrease in Pentobarbital-induced sleeping time induced by selective A1 antagonist DPCPX and selective A2A antagonist SCH58261.^[5]

Thus Theacrine can not possibly have the same activity at Adenosine receptors as Caffeine, since they exert antagonistic effects in rats. I should also add here that Caffeine is most likely an inverse agonist at the A2aR.^[6]

Although we don't have conclusive evidence of this, I'd like to suggest that Theacrine is a partial agonist at Adenosine receptor sites. Additionally, the most exhaustive article on Theacrine available also suggests this possibility.^[7]

Additionally, unlike Caffeine, Theacrine exerts no effects on blood pressure or heartrate.^[8]

It can thus be deemed unlikely that Theacrine like Caffeine causes release of ACTH, Cortisol and Epinephrine, although no conclusive evidence exists as of yet.^[9] However it has been noted that Theacrine does not exert traditional thermogenic effects like Caffeine and Citrus Aurantium does.^[7]

Furthermore, Theacrine has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in rat models.^[10]

This effect is not shared by Caffeine. As a layman I will suggest that Theacrine might have activity at the A3R, since it mediates widespread and significant inflammatory responses. However, there is no evidence of this perspective.^[11]

Theacrine also lowers serum cholesterol in human trials.^[12] Caffeine seems to exert a weak opposite effect, Coffee having been noted to increase serum LDL-Cholesterol.^[13]

Finally, Theacrine has no hazardous interactions with Caffeine in adult humans.^[14]

***TL;DR***

Theacrine is not an agonist of, nor does it bind to, any of the Dopamine receptors. It is most likely a partial agonist at Adenosine receptors or induces Adenosine release by other mechanisms, since it has opposite effects to Caffeine and Theobromine in rat studies utilizing Pentobarbital.

Theacrine is not thermogenic, it has positive effects on motivation and pain but will not burn fat any faster than placebo. It has strong antiinflammatory effects, however the significance of this is not yet known. It lowers total serum cholesterol levels.

It's my opinion and I need to express it:

I really think that a lot of people here underestimate the potency of the placebo effect. I see these threads about how l-theanine ""cured"" somebody's crippling anxiety, or how they used to be a loser but since taking piracetam all the sudden they are super smart and shit, and I cannot help but feel very skeptical towards such claims.

I know very well that a specific substance can work even if you don't ""feel"" anything. I also know that people have different brain chemistry, etc. 
But consider this:

People tend to think that they are immune to placebo, but that's simply not the case. Nobody is. Even the smartest person in the world can get fed an illusion. The placebo effect is very, **VERY** powerful and should definitely not be underestimated.

We would definitely benefit from more double-blind self-tests à la Gwern.


Therefore, unless you do rigorous double-blinded self-experiments to eliminate, or at the very least -limit- the possibility of placebo effect, please don't tell people how ""l-theanine **definitely** cured my anxiety !!!!1!!1"" and use words such as ""seems to"" and ""may have"" more often.",2016-02-08 09:46:29

Yet many of the reports are in conflict, and there is no consensus on the general efficacy of almost anything - this is because the missing half of the equation is you.


The medical field also suffers from this: its tools are blunt sledgehammers like benzos, tricyclics and SNRI/NDRIs that may fix 2-3 things while breaking two (often more) previously balanced systems. Even things as ubiquitous seeming as ADD, ADHD and Anxiety are being recognized as having many possible causes (and consequently, sub-types). 


There is little mystery as to how things like 5-HTP, Picamilon or Choline will impact ""the brain"". What's missing is the guide which will let people find out how they will impact THEIR brain. To solve this, we need to shift from substance-centric to neurochemistry-centric discussion. For now, I'm simply encouraging every user to do their own research.


In the future, I'd like to start with Serotonin / Dopamine / Norepinephrine and branch off into GABA, Glutamate, ACh, etc - threads for each, collecting symptoms, clusters, and how to narrow it down enough for accurate self-experimentation by adjusting one factor at a time without medical tests and equipment out of reach for most of us.

Background story: Ever since hitting puberty, I've experienced a great deal of anxiety, both generalized and social. I always knew something was just not right with me, only later to find out I have Asperger's. People with this condition tend to have some special interests they obsess over, and something I love researching/experimenting with is nootropics. My main goal was getting my anxiety and moods under control, and I've tried dozens and dozens of nootropics/vitamins/supplements for this reason. I've experimented with many other nootropics for memory/cognitive-enhancement/mental-sharpness, but for the sake of this post, I will talk about ones that have helped me with anxiety. I've noticed many subscribers of this subreddit also suffer from anxiety, and a calm mind is one of the best nootropics there is IMO. This community is awesome and has helped me a lot, so hopefully this post will help someone else! I rated each of them in terms of personal anxiety relief. Remember, what didn't work for me might work for you, and vice versa. I just realized halfway through writing this that its a really long post, so I'll break it up into a few parts instead for time purposes.

-Bacopa (7/10): My first nootropic experience, and it was a good one. I noticed acute effects of lowered anxiety, and over the course of a few months noticed increased memory. This amazing herb is subltle enough that I feel normal, but noticable enough that I felt less stress and anxiety. I didn't even realize how great it was until I got off of it, and started experienceing my usual increased anxiety. It wasnt like an acute ""Wow, I feel so calm"" feeling, more like a background calm. Like turning down the volume of anxiety a couple of notches. Looking back at it, the 6-7 months I used it I was in a much better place mentally.

-Theanine (2/10): I know this is very popular in this subreddit, but personally I felt no noticable effects from it. I've tried suntheanine, and a few other brands since it is pretty hyped on here and similar forums, but unfortunately I'm just personally a non-responder. I would recommend trying this if you suffer from anxiety, since many people find it helps them. 

-Phenibut(10/10): My holy grail of social anxiety relief. The first time I took it was absolutely mind blowing. I was about 17 working at a supermarket bagging groceries (LOL) and dealing with terrible anxiety, especially social anxiety; talking to customers all day made me very on edge all day and mentally drained at the end of the day. I tried a 1 gram dose of phenibut, and 4 hours later, I felt the best I have ever felt in my life. ""The world was my playground"" is quote from a fellow redditor that perfectly describes my experience with this substance. I was flirting with girls, hi-fiving everybody, and just felt fucking awesome. Like I just felt great to be alive, everyone felt like a good friend, and I was so charming/whitty/outgoing. Unfortunately as many of you already know, these effects are not sustainable with regular use and rebound anxiety is a bitch. Fortunately, this led me to research the mechanisms of action of phenibut and Gaba-B, which led to my discovery of the following substance.

-Baclofen(10/10): Not really a nootropic, but it felt identical to phenibut. Whats even better, I was able to take it regularly and keep the anxiety-reducing benefits of phenibut without the extreme tolerance and other side effects. I'm convinced I have some kind of gaba-B dysfuntion, because baclofen causes me to feel normal. I'm more comfortable in social situations, and its effects on empathy and mood have made this an absolute staple for me.

-Kava-Kava (6/10): First I tried cheap Kava, then was told I have to make my own kava from a good powder. My experiences were not that great: terrible taste, headaches, and groggyness were the main effects I got from this. Oh, and a slight anxiety reduction. I have read that kava has a reverse tolerance(meaning the longer you take it, the stronger the effects are). I want to continue experimenting with this though, because I dont believe I've taken it for long enough periods and maybe my quality of root was not that great.

-Picamilon(4/10): Another popular anxiety nootropic, unfortunately it didnt do much for me. I've read many people are not very impressed with it either, howevery YMMV.

-N-acetyl-cystine(9/10): This stuff is awesome, and is another staple for me. My experience with NAC is less intrusive thoughts, decrease in impulsiveness, and it literally CURED my trichtillomania. It also prevents hangovers for me when taken a couple of hours before a night out drinking with friends.

-Memantine (7/10): For the first few days, I felt amazing on it. I definitely felt an increased mood and decreased anxiety. Those effects subdued, and I was left with some mood stabilization and tolerance reduction to stimulants.

-Colouracetam(7/10): This is my favorite racetam. I feel an increase in mood and a nice, clear, calm mind. For some reason, Ceretropic's sublingual version is the only one that I feel noticable effects from. I will probably end up buying some bulk powder from them, because I'm thinking maybe I just got some bunk powder from the other vendor I tried.

-Noopept(6/10): This stuff has such a psychedelic vibe for me. An increase in colors and an appreciation for scenery (LOL) are the main effects I felt from it. It didnt do too much for my anxiety, but I did find taking it sublingually helped my verbal fluidity in social situations, so that definetly a plus.

-Aniracetam (6/10): This is a popular racetam that many users descibe as being anxiolytic. Besides the first few doses, it did not do too much for my anxiety personally. I even tried taking it with Omega-3 as someone suggested to me, and still nothing too noticeable. I may try this one again, maybe this time with a regular 3x daily dosage. The only effect that I really enjoyed was making music sound better, and that also faded after the first few doses.

-Phosphatidylserine (8/10): I know that the bovine sources are not used anymore for this supplement and other sources of it do not have very good research, but it made a pretty big impact as far as stress reduction for me. I felt less physical anxiety in social situations, and did not get as hot as I would during social interaction. Normally I would start sweating bullets, my voice would crack, and people who shook my hand would ask me why my palms were so sweaty. lol

I was initially going to write all my experiences but didnt realize how long this post became. This is only a fraction of my experiences, and I will write up the rest if anyone is interested. Off the top of my head, I have also tried bromantane, ashwaghanda, emoxypine, etifoxine, holy basil, low dose naltrexone, tianeptine, klonopin, semax, inositol, DMAE, galantamine, PEA, 5-HTP, gabapentin, rhodiola, kratom, L-tryptophan/tyrosine, and some others as well. Let me know if there are any of those you would like for me to write a review on.",2015-04-27 15:14:49

Recently there was a post about the relation between gut health and mental health, and it piqued my interest in creating a stack to help facilitate healing and microbriome regrowth. After diving into google scholar articles and acknowledging the relation between gut health and mental acuity, I'm convinced this is the best stack to assist with repairing your microbiome and gut health. I started a variation of this stack a couple months ago in addition to some other noots/peptides, and it's made some subtle but perceptible improvements in my life already. Hopefully it helps ya'll too. 


**Studies**

* [Stress & the gut-brain axis: Regulation by the microbiome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289516300509)
 * The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations.
 * Several lines of evidence support the suggestion that gut microbiota influence stress-related behaviours, including those relevant to anxiety and depression. Work using germ-free (GF) mice (i.e., delivered surgically and raised in sterile isolators with no microbial exposure) demonstrates a link between microbiota and anxiety-like behaviour (Neufeld et al., 2011; Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011 ;  Clarke et al., 2013). In particular, reduced anxiety-like behaviour in GF mice was shown in the light-dark box test and in the elevated plus maze (see (Luczynski et al., 2016a) for review). On the other hand, GF rats display the opposite phenotype, and are characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour (Crumeyrolle-Arias et al., 2014). Interestingly, the transfer of stress-prone Balb/C microbiota to GF Swiss Webster (SW) mice has been shown to increase anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal SW mice, while transfer of SW microbiota to GF Balb/C mice reduced anxiety-related behaviour compared to normal Balb/C mice suggesting a direct role for microbiota composition in behaviour (Bercik et al., 201
 * Gene expression within the hippocampus also is markedly different in GF mice compared to normal controls. The hippocampus exerts strong control over the HPA stress axis, and GF mice are characterized by markedly increased hippocampal 5-HT concentrations (Clarke et al., 2013), accompanied by decreased 5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the dentate gyrus in female (but not male) GF mice (Neufeld et al., 2011). Intriguingly, other CNS alterations in GF mice also are sex-dependent; e.g., altered expression of BDNF has been documented only in male GF mice (Clarke et al., 2013). BDNF is an important plasticity-related protein that promotes neuronal growth, development and survival, with key roles in learning, memory and mood regulation. BDNF gene expression is lower in the cortex and amygdala in male GF mice compared with controls (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), whereas hippocampal BDNF levels in GF mice have been reported to either increase (Neufeld et al., 2011) or decrease (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011; Clarke et al., 2013 ;  Sudo et al., 2004).
 * Therefore, gut microbiota may play a crucial role in tryptophan availability and metabolism to consequently impact central 5-HT concentrations. Although the specific mechanisms underlying this putative modulatory interaction are unknown, they are potentially mediated indirectly through an immune-related mechanism linked to microbial colonization 
 * **Animal studies have led the way in showing that specific strains of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus or Bacteroides can have positive effects on brain and behaviour ( Hsiao et al., 2013; Bravo et al., 2011; Bercik et al., 2011b; Savignac et al., 2014 ;  Savignac et al., 2015), including evidence that certain bacteria can enhance cognitive processes and affect emotional learning**


* [Gut–brain axis: how the microbiome influences anxiety and depression](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/60c0/58682d907fe80befc23e58f279d34ade23f1.pdf)
 * Significant progress has been made over the past decade in
recognizing the importance of gut microbiota to brain
function. Key findings show that stress influences the
composition of the gut microbiota and that bidirectional
communication between microbiota and the CNS influences
stress reactivity. Several studies have shown that
microbiota influence behavior and that immune challenges
that influence anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors are
associated with alterations in microbiota. Emerging work
notes that alterations in microbiota modulate plasticityrelated,
serotonergic, and GABAergic signaling systems in
the CNS. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity
to consider how the gut–brain axis and, in particular, new
tools will allow researchers to understand how dysbiosis of
the microbiome influences mental illness.


* [A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159115000884)
 *  We found that a 4-week multispecies probiotic intervention reduced self-reported cognitive reactivity to sad mood, as indexed by the LEIDS-r (van der Does and Williams, 2003; van der Does, 2005 ;  Kruijt et al., 2013). Further analyses showed that the strongest beneficial effects were observed for the aggression and rumination subscales, indicating that in the probiotics supplementation condition participants perceived themselves to be less distracted by aggressive and ruminative thoughts when in a sad mood.

**Forgot to mention EDIT:** For those of you who eat a lot of bad food, be aware of a possible Herxheimer reaction if cutting a lot of sugar/carbs in conjunction with this stack. A year ago, I went hard into keto after being on a very high sugar/high carb diet, and I had what is typically called ""the keto flu"", but I believe this effect is more due to the massive die off of bacteria in your gut that feeds on sugars and carbs. I've had a few friends try this similar stack(high sugar diets), and have a ""sick"" couple of days in the beginning even though they only cut back on some sugary stuff. Light migraine, sore throat/tonsils, and general fatigue. Feels like a 100% manageable flu, but it's still unpleasant. Anti-inflammatory supplements help with this but only so much. This typically lasts a day or two. 


**FINAL EDIT Summary:** 

I think this stack covers a large majority of the bases required to propagate gut flora and increase general intestinal health, while providing nootropic benefits in relation to social fluidity, mood, mental energy, and emotional health. Starting with the probiotic, I chose Garden of Life(100 Billion CFU) for a variety of reasons. First it has all the popular beneficial strains, in addition to a diverse amount of subtly mood boosting strains. After doing some googling, it looks like there is a decent balance between the histamine increasing/reducing, the immuno-modulator, nutrient absorption promoting, mood boosting, anti inflammatory, and  stool improving strains. Taking GOL in addition to the prebiotic strain from Vitamin Shoppe provides all the prebiotic goodness to help facilitate the beneficial flora to grow and actually populate the gut long term. 


Glutamine, NAG, Quercetin, Collagen, and Aloe Vera juice all help grow the intestinal mucosa back to its normal state, and regrow the Microvillus that gets damaged with chronic bowel disease. For the good bacteria to stick around long term, it needs that mucous layer for protection. Another important factor that most people overlook in gut health is digestive enzymes. Certain strains of bacteria can change the acidity of your stomach and intestines, which can cause all sorts of problems with digestive effectiveness and as a result, your nutrient absorption. Super enzymes are a staple in any one of my stacks, simply because you can never digest food too well, right? The last 3 supplements are Caprylic Acid/Coconut Oil, Omega 3s, and Vitamin D. Omega 3s and Coconut oil both assist with Butyrate production, which provides tremendous benefits with ""how you feel"" via its anti-inflammatory action. It also helps with weight loss and insulin sensitivity. Vitamin D is also a general fix all and something everyone should be taking. Unless you work outside for a large majority of your day, you're probably not getting enough vitamin D. 4000IU is the recommended daily allowance, so 5000IU should be fine for everyone. Vitamin D is also essential for gene functions that pertain gut flora, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways regulated via the VDR receptors. Hopefully this helps you folks with gut problems get back to guaranteed regularity, it's certainly helped me.

"Zinc, Magnesium, Vitamin B6, Iron and Vitamin C may play a prominent role in ADHD.",292,ae8m21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ae8m21/zinc_magnesium_vitamin_b6_iron_and_vitamin_c_may/,94,1547081004.0,"[Micronutrient Deficiencies in ADHD: A Global Research Consensus](https://isom.ca/article/micronutrient-deficiencies-adhd-global-research-consensus/)

&#x200B;

Summary:  Mineral deficiencies may play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, and Vitamin B6 appear to have substantial effects on ADHD symptoms. 

&#x200B;

**Zinc** 

Zinc deficiency represents one of the most-recognized micronutrient deficiencies linked to ADHD symptoms. With key roles in enzyme activation and neurotransmitter synthesis, zinc is critical for regulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). 

**Vitamin B6**

In addition to supporting magnesium metabolism, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), as pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), has independently essential roles in the nervous system, energy production, neurotransmitter synthesis, heme production, and is critical for strong immune function and the inflammatory response (Ho et al., 2016; Rucklidge et al., 2017; Ueland et al., 2017).

**Iron**

At appropriate concentrations, iron is another essential cofactor in the enzymatic production of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (Rucklidge et al., 2017). Most reliably assessed by serum ferritin, low iron status is a significant but heterogeneous risk factor for ADHD.

**Magnesium**

Possibly the most crucial micronutrient for optimal brain performance, magnesium participates in virtually all enzyme reactions, nerve signal conduction, and in the function of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Magnesium also plays a key role in the excitation status of nerves through inhibition of excitatory glutamate receptors and promotion of GABA reception (Greenblatt, 2017). Deficiency of magnesium is identified in almost all cases of ADHD, and is widespread even in healthy populations (Moshfegh, A. et al., 2009).

**Vitamin C**

Vitamin C is a critical component of the antioxidant system. Heightened oxidative stress caused by chronic inflammation, heavy metal or other environmental exposures, and hyperexcited neurons place heavy demands on the brain’s antioxidant system. ",2019-01-10 06:13:24

L-theanine+Caffeine is f*cking amazing,293,emu26p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/emu26p/ltheaninecaffeine_is_fcking_amazing/,168,1578705681.0,"I originally started taking it daily back in 2018 for anxiety during college, previously I had ALWAYS suffered from focus and motivational issues, to the point where I failed my prior exams and was fired from my first job. I ended up coming first in my class with the highest grades by far, something I’d attribute to the supplement. 

At some point early last year I stopped taking it because I didn’t feel like I needed it anymore for anxiety and I could deal with stress a lot better. Afterwards I genuinely think it had a huge positive impact on my anxiety long term. Things that previously used to cause me stress just didn’t any more. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to now. I recently started a new job that requires 2 solid months of classroom based training and there’s lots of information to take in that we’re tested on. I find it extremely hard to take in and stay focused over long periods of time, despite consuming coffee throughout the day. 

On the Friday of the second week we took a group test and I ended up scoring literally bottom of the group. Disappointing. 

The following Monday I had fairly bad non-work related anxiety, so I took some L-theanine and caffeine and continued to do so throughout the week and onto the following week also. By the end of the fourth week we had another test which I didn’t have a clue was coming which was supposed to be a lot more intense than the first. 

Long story short, I scored highest in the group, by a really significant margin, from being literally lowest.

You could put it down to being conscious of my performance and focusing more based on that, but I know myself I didn’t. Literally nothing changed apart from taking that supplement.",2020-01-11 06:51:21

If you have ever **hated having to pay for journal articles** then read on.

Many of these articles can be found for free.

[1] **Google Scholar** - https://scholar.google.com/

   The ""advance search"" option (drop-down on the right side) helps find articles by title, author, publications and by publication date.

[2] Free JSTOR account - http://www.jstor.org/

   This gives you 3 articles a month for free.  I list this below google scholar because there are no questions about copyright and legality.  I PERSONALLY NEVER USE THIS as Canada has better copyright laws than most so it is not worth the trouble.

[3] Reddit Scholar - https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/

   This is a great place to ask someone else to do the work for you.  Again, I find it easier to get the stuff myself.  Mostly I learned how through /r/scholar

[4] Libgen - http://libgen.io/scimag/

  **This is magic** Go to Libgen.  Search for a subject.  Download free PDF.  You don’e even have to know the author or proper title. For example, a search on “caffeine” gives me the first 100 results (telling me I should be more specific to get exactly what I want).  A search for [lions mane](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=lion%27s+mane&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives me 21 results including a review by the title [Chemistry, Nutrition, and Health-Promoting Properties of Hericium erinaceus {Lion’s Mane} Mushroom Fruiting Bodies and Mycelia and Their Bioactive Compounds](http://cyber.sci-hub.bz/MTAuMTAyMS9hY3MuamFmYy41YjAyOTE0/10.1021%40acs.jafc.5b02914.pdf).

 **Note that many Libgen articles are downloaded from Sch-Hub**.  If the libgen servers are busy, you often get redirected to Sci-Hub for your search.

[5] Sci-Hub - http://sci-hub.io/

   The [wiki on Sci-Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) says

>Sci-Hub is a website with over 62 million academic papers and articles available for direct download. **It bypasses publisher paywalls by allowing access through educational institution proxies.** Sci-Hub stores papers in its own repository, and additionally the papers downloaded by Sci-Hub are also stored in Library Genesis (LibGen).


Sometimes when searching on Sci-Hub you get this message

>search temporarily unavailable, please use DOI or direct links

>If you're using Google chrome, you can install Sci-Hub extension to use search.
To do this: . . . 

They give a download link for a google chrome extension - click, unzip and install.

Sci-Hub does not work every time as publishers are always working against them, but it has every paper you want.

EDIT:

/u/jminuse gives a good caution to **look for review articles** when you are new to a subject.  Also, if there are multiple reviews don't forget to read the most recent one.

ALSO - **Never draw conclusions from one study.**

For example a google scholar search of [bacopa review](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bacopa+review) is a much better starting place than just random searching. (still over 7600 found)

Searching the [same with LibGen](http://libgen.io/scimag/?s=bacopa+review&journalid=&v=&i=&p=&redirect=1) gives 5 results that are exactly what I was looking for.

In the summer of 2012, I was returning to school, eager to get ahead, and came across [this post](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/) after doing a cursory search for 'smart drugs.' With that, my journey into the world of nootropics began.


I don't necessarily want to do a review of every substance I've tried so much as offer some insights over what I've observed, both within myself and the community these past few years.

1) **Like any community, the nootropics scene periodically undergoes trends, fads and changing consensuses.** When I first began frequenting Longecity and /r/nootropics, the general consensus was the -racetams (so long as you were a responder) represented the best risk/reward available, modafinil was the closest thing to a real world 'Limitless' drug, and a handful of other substances (e.g., pyritinol, bacopa, ALCAR, etc.) were of varying benefit. Fast forward a year or so and hype around CILTEP reached fever pitch, only to be thoroughly debunked by a popular post here. At some point in between, phenylpiracetam became more widespread at economical prices (for awhile, its high cost was a barrier), tianeptine rose from an obscure antidepressant to one of the more well-known nootropics, and uridine+DHA+choline was regarded by some as one of the best longer-term stacks. Later still, Semax, Selank et al. became household names, risk tolerances transitioned markedly from demanding a near absence of side effects to an overarching willingness to experiment with research chemicals holding little-to-no human safety evidence, and the downsides of phenibut became thoroughly entrenched in popular opinion. 3 years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if the popular discourse had changed further still.

**2) Anecdotally, I've found the best nootropics tend to be Russian.** I'm not sure whether it's arisen from a need for solutions to the resulting bran damage that high incidences of alcoholism inflicts, a scientific community more willing to pursue treatments intended to improve rather than simply treat, or something else endogenous to the culture, but invariably, my best experiences have come from Russian nootropics - e.g., phenylpiracetam, Semax, bromantane and to a lesser extent, Noopept.

**3) My responses to various substances have evolved over time.** When I first took piracetam, I felt a sense of immense clear-headedness. Now I'm lucky if I even remember taking it halfway through the day, and question whether it grants anything beyond placebo. (Evidence of benefit among healthy samples essentially boils down to a single study from the 70's; see [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00426834).) Likewise, various adaptogens were godsends for my focus, energy and alertness; now, I hardly feel much of anything from the likes of ginkgo, ginseng, rhodiola, etc. Targeting micronutrient deficiencies might be at play here; unbeknownst to me at the time, I was fairly deficient in both vitamin D and B12 during my introduction to nootropics. Later lab tests uncovered both, and subsequent supplementation fixed a good deal of issues I had in terms of energy and sleep, yet coincided with a change in response to components of my stack.

**4) The often-discussed U-shaped response curve applies to nearly everything.** I recently read a post of someone complaining that this forum is excessively indulgent in prescribing exercise as the cure-all for everything, and that he had been doing so regularly and strenuously for the past few years with little in the way of benefits. Likely true. What else is true, though, especially across the current literature, is there is such a thing as both too little and too much exercise  (see [1](http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleID=2108914)). Similarly, while the health food world is awash in kale-love, overconsumption might end up exposing oneself to high levels of thallium (see [2](http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2015/07/kale-silent-killer)). The same can be said for excessive reliance on stimulants, high levels of supplemental antioxidants, etc. On the other hand, the benefits of quality aerobic, strength and HIIT-based workouts is insane when dosed appropriately, and has led to more personal benefits than anything else outside the concurrent use of a few select stimulants, Russian compounds, meditation and diet. In earlier times, I was on the extreme end of the spectrum when I reached a semi-elite amateur level in competitive endurance sports - and had little to show in terms of cognitive fluidity.

**5) Simple stacks are often best; distilling a stack down to its most effective components is underrated.** People (ideally) tend to transition across three stages in their nootropics journey: i) dipping one's feet in the water with a few 'starter' nootropics, e.g., caffeine + theaine, piracetam + ALCAR, etc.; ii) an aggressive experimentation phase where the aim is to figure out what works in a swift manner; and iii) a return to the basics once one determines what personally benefits them. Far too often, I read reports where someone has tried whatever the current research chemical du-jour is and writes a glowing report after < 1 week's usage, only to detail that they also take a plethora of other RC's, a few prescriptions and possibly occasional dips into pyschoactive, non-nootropic compounds. Such reports, IMO, are completely bogus with the amount of confounding factors present. The reality that doesn't get acknowledged often enough is we often have little-to-no data on long-term outcomes for even the classic nootropics, let alone combinations of such. The last place you want to be is taking 12 different things, have a debilitating side effect creep in and not have any idea where it's arising from.

**6) At some point, you have to really ask yourself about personal risk tolerances.** I think a general consensus around here is the willingness to trade long-term uncertainty for short-to-mid-term benefits. The question is, at what point does the trade-off begin to lose value? For example, could you tolerate persistent paresthesia, tinnitus, etc., if it meant improving cognition, improving anxiety, removing depression, etc.? How about a trade-off in working memory if it meant being able to memorize things photographically, perhaps to the point where you forgot what your manager just said seconds after walking away? Oftentimes, free lunches are tough to find in the world of homeostasis.

**7) Figure out your lowest-hanging fruit and target that first.** For me, figuring out a deficiency in B12 and D were godsends. Later, figuring out that I had polymorphisms at the SNP level signaling a lifelong greater need for said vitamins was enlightening as to why I became deficient in the first place despite abundant sunlight and animal product consumption. Likewise, going from a few weeks of near-complete sedentary work to 3-4 days of cardio and strength training has swift, dramatic effects on my rapidity of thought, ability to internalize technical subjects, and general mood/outlook.

**8) Know thyself - otherwise, it's easy to get caught up on others' glowing reports.** A perfect example would be tianeptine - invariably, a handful of people with debilitating depression have found immense benefits and few downsides given appropriate dosages. Said people have gone on to write glowing reports when the subject comes up. Myself, being the curious mind that I am, read such reports and decide I might like to experience said benefits myself - while momentarily neglecting that I have neither clinical depression nor the same brain chemistry as those whose posts I'm reading. Conversely, I find that nootropics that are popular among the ADHD crowd tend to have disproportionately positive effects - e.g., uridine+DHA+choline, Semax, etc. Yet modafinil is occasionally touted for its concentration-enhancing effects, and I've personally found it to be almost anti-nootropic in that I have an abundance of wakefulness but lose out on creativity, problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

**9) Some of the best nootropics are often not things you can find in a pill.** For example, when I had regular access to a sauna, I found the combination of hot and cold exposure to be immensely beneficial both for focus and sleep. When I'm in areas where natural settings are readily accessible, a few hours spent hiking leaves me thoroughly able to write well after. When I take a weekend sabbatical from smart devices, laptops, etc., I find my ability to sit down and be productive on a single task, like reading a demanding book, skyrockets. 

**10) Take breaks from time to time.** Nootropics, when they work, are awesome. Knowing your baseline is equally awesome. Saving money, even more so. Even with everything I've experimented with, I've found one of the most effective things in terms of boosting mood, productivity, rapidity of thought, etc. is strong espresso (and when the jitters arrive, a dash of theanine) after taking 3-4 weeks completely off caffeine. My response under such a scenario is almost to the point where if I could gain said benefits without the tolerance that comes from consistent use, I'd need little else. Invariably, the benefits begin decreasing after a week or so of use, and by week 3 or 4 of daily caffeine intake, the need to up dosages simply for the wakefulness aspect becomes a near-necessity. Breaks and their resultant tolerance reduction are awesome, though often highly inconvenient given a demanding work/academic schedule. When you have the chance, though, don't discount the utility of time away from the pill cabinet.",2015-08-17 11:09:36

Toxoplasma Gondii is typically said to be asymptomatic in immunocompetent infected hosts and remains latent for its lifetime.

&#x200B;

Since this ""asymptomatic"" infection has been shown to be linked to [neurotransmitters imbalances](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395614002866) that could impair one's thinking process, I was wondering if somebody got cured and noticed a difference. The treatment usually involves a several month long course of combined antibiotics.

The infection is very common, as in half of French, German and Belgian people are infected. Incidence in the US is lower at around 15%.

"Alright I'm fully convinced, gut microbiome and inflammation is DIRECTLY linked to depression/dysthymia. I just had got over a horrible case of giardia and experienced 180 degree flips in mood, energy, motivation.",286,9ssjnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ssjnr/alright_im_fully_convinced_gut_microbiome_and/,160,1540965560.0,"Picked up Giardia when I was on the CDT this year. Had just finished Colorado and was on the last 700ish miles to go. Was feeling great, energized, excited to finish another thru-hike, doing 30-35miles a day. Then bam giardia hit and I started shitting and vomiting everything I ate or drank. Went from 178lbs to 163lbs in a matter of two weeks. I wasn't even able to keep water down and became extremely dehydrated in the first 4 days.

&#x200B;

I've suspected that the gut microbiome has played a large part in my fatigue and depression but getting giardia has convinced me beyond any doubt. It apparently likes to feed on glucose so you're not supposed to eat sugar. I didn't realize this in the first few days and tried to drink gatorades and eat ice-cream to get any sort of calories in my body. I noticed that immediately after ingesting the sugar, one I would very often throw up, but also my joints would flare up with pain. After almost 1,900 miles hiked my body was holding up surprisingly well and were mostly pain free but immediately after eating sugars they would all flare up with pain, which was a signal of inflammation. So the inflammation in my gut was carrying over to inflammation in the rest of the body.

&#x200B;

Well it got so bad I got off trail and came home. On trail I was really looking forward to coming home so I could relax, watch movies, and play video games. But when I actually got home for the life of me I couldn't get into ANY games or movies. They all had zero fun. I didn't want to do anything. Nothing was interesting or fun. Classic depression. 

&#x200B;

I wrote it off to being sick but even after I started to recover and put some weight back on the dysthymia stayed. It was only in the last few days when I've made a concerted effort to eliminate all sugar and get in loads of fiber from lentils and other veggies and also megadosing a probiotic that's worked well for me in the past that I've felt better. And the change has been overnight. Two days ago I was still feeling depressed and had no interest in anything. Today I had so much energy and motivation I went to the gym and am really getting into Path of Exile. 

&#x200B;

Oh another weird and interesting side-effect. I have HORRIBLE seasonal allergies which have only gotten worse as I've gotten older. In the last 5 years I have to blow my nose for an hour after waking up even in the dead of winter. Oddly when I had giardia I had zero sinus issues and even now my sinuses have been much more clear then they used to be. So it appears that my allergies are linked to my gut microbiome and whatever was causing it has been flushed out of my system. 

&#x200B;

Just wanted to share. If you suffer from a general malaise, lack of energy, lack of motivation, lack of interest in things you used to find interesting you might want to take a look at your diet and try some probiotics. I always knew that when I ""ate better"" I felt better but generally linked that to having more nutrients and less carbs thus less insulin response. Now I wonder if the true mechanism is more to do with whether you're feeding the ""good"" bacteria in your gut and starving the ""bad"" when you ""eat better"" rather than how your body handles the macronutrient content. Probably a mixture of both but I think the effect of the microbiome needs a lot more attention then we give it. ",2018-10-31 11:29:20

I have  dealt with anhedonia for over 12 years, likely longer.  I can't even remember the last time I felt joy.  I never really thought I was depressed, because I'm still a high functioning very productive person.  I never went to the doctor for feelings of depression for multiple reasons.  I have a great life, great job, terrific family, and my wife is the love of my life . . . . . . . just absolutely no joy.  I couldn't anticipate it.  I have had a pituitary adenoma for over 25 years (prolactinoma).  Rather large one that has responded to dostinex, but my prolactin levels are still much too high for a typical male.  No other side affects of the condition other than occasional headaches that I can tell, but I'm sure it's possible even likely to have affected my hormonal balance.  Dostinex is a dopamine agonist so I'm sure that is also playing a factor in all of this.  I started taking Lion's Mane  (2 weeks ago) on a whim with niacin as a result of hearing Paul Stamets.  The first week I noticed that I could think clearer, and that I was able to cope a little better with life.  I've always been a very critical person when it comes to small irritants.  Things like little messes around the house or illogical actions.  It would take everything within me not to speak critically or chastise someone for something they did.  Now I was able to brush it off, and take care of the small irritant myself.  That's weird . . . . . . REALLY weird.  Now at the end of week 2, and I am overwhelmed.  I went for a walk with my wife today and proclaimed that I could actually feel the wind on my face.  No, you don't get it.  I can FEEL the wind on my face.  The sun was shining, a breeze was blowing, the birds were singing.  I can't even describe it.  I actually called my mom last night.  That doesn't happen!  I talked to her for 2 hours!  Do you know how hard it is to sleep when you're feeling joy for the first time in a decade?  2 decades????  I had to get out of bed because I kept crying in my sleep thinking about my kids.  I feel like being interviewed on Oprah.  This is unreal.

Update 04/13/2019:

It's been another week, and though the exuberance has subsided I am still feeling the positive affects of the LM/Niacin.  I really notice it when I do something new or go somewhere I haven't been for a while.  I visited my folks yesterday and when i walked into their house which I have done many times, I absolutely noticed the difference.  Everything was sharper and the lighting, though dim, seemed to have more energy.  It's like going from life with a 3 color palette to a 12 color palette.  We had a very lengthy conversation and I shared much of what I have been dealing with for the last 12 years.  It was wonderful.  I hadn't had a long personal conversation with them since I don't know when.  All because of the peace and joy that I now have.  They definitely noticed the change.  Needless to say after many hours of talking into the night, we hugged and I broke down in tears because of how happy I was to finally connect with them again.  We've always had a good relationship, but due to the state that I have been in for so long, I have harbored resentment and frustration.  I just couldn't figure out why no one could understand me.  I now have so much peace.  I love talking about deep and difficult topics, but now I can do it with much more grace.  It's great to still be feeling better and even better when others see it in you.",2019-04-06 23:57:36

Funny that the news of a few purity issues with some of our common suppliers is coming out at this time.

I have been working(with a few others) on **creating a lab testing service** to help benefit our community.

&#x200B;

Our ""organization"" has acquired many analytical chemistry tools for testing nootropics.

**Our inventory right now is** :

FTIR, UV/Vis, Raman Spectrometer

Melting point apparatus

TLC Places

Plenty of solvents

Reagents for heavy metal testing methods..

&#x200B;

I would like to open this resource as a **non-profit** in hope of **increasing safety** and fact checking around these parts. In addition I would like to see some people step forward to help lead this effort as I want this not to be my own project but a **community effort**.

&#x200B;

Our current website is:

A Common Sense Guide to Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus),280,d5f9g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d5f9g0/a_common_sense_guide_to_lions_mane_hericium/,89,1568746446.0,"Lion's Mane (Yamabushitake, Hericium erinaceus) is a mushroom that's thought to have nootropic effects. Lion's Mane has been used for over one thousand years in Chinese medicine as a treatment for 'gastricism' (it was thought that many disorders were caused by digestion issues). In recent years Lion's Mane has been researched because of its possible pro-cognitive effects. The research can be confusing so I thought I would dig into it and try to demystify Lion's Mane for myself and others.

There are many varieties of compounds in Lion's Mane but to date most of the research has focused on four main categories:

###Hericenones

Hericenones are aromatic compounds isolated from the fruiting body (the visible growth of the mushroom, often called the actual mushroom or toadstool, the part that produces spores) of Lion's Mane.

Hericenones C, D and E exhibit NGF stimulating activity. Of the Hericenones, Hericenone D is the most potent, almost as potent as epinephrine, the reference compound for NGF stimulation.

3-Hydroxyhericenone F has shown protective activity against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent Neuro2a cell death

###Erinacines

Erinacines are cyathane-type diterpenoid compounds that are derived from Lion's mane. These compounds tend to have NGF stimulating activity, interestingly they're not unique to Lion's mane. Scabronines A, B, C, D, E and F and Cyrneines A and B are another set of similar compounds with NGF stimulating activity, which were isolated from the fruiting bodies of Sarcodon scabrosus and Sarcodon cyrneus, respectively. Similar compounds can be found across multiple species, including the mushroom cyathus africanus [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20472-4) and the fungus cyathus striatus [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746852) it's unclear how common or uncommon they are. Although similar compounds have been found in the fruiting bodies of other mushrooms, at least for the time being they have only been isolated in mycelium for Lion's mane.

###Polysaccharides

By weight dried lion's mane is about 60-80% polysaccharides. B-glucans,A-glucans and glucan-protein complexes are the main representative polysaccharides. Lion Mane's polysaccharides are found disproportionately in the fruiting body, but are also found in the myclia. The polysaccharides in lion's mane have many possible benefits, including immunomodulation and anti-diabetic effects. Some evidence suggests polysaccharides from lion's mane may have neuroprotective effects against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity. [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266872)

###Sterols

Erinarols J a compound found in the methanol extract of the fruiting body of lion's mane exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects. It was shown to reduce TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. [[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794894)

What was used: 0.8 grams of a powdered fruiting body

##Conclusion

Lion's Mane is a mushroom with a wide range of possible benefits. The compounds responsible for the potential benefits are distributed throughout the mushroom, the fruiting body and the mycelium. Special extracts and processes are probably not necessary and not warranted by the research, the main trial that ignited the recent interest in Lion's Mane simply used dried mushroom powder, other recent trials used a mix of fruiting body and mycelia extracts or simply a fruiting body extract. Erinacines are found in the fruiting body and the mycelium, Hericenones are found in the fruiting body. There hasn't been enough research to know what is the correct dosages are. There may be an inverted U shaped dose response curve when neuroplasticity is involved (it's possible to get too much and too little for optimal results). 

It's also interesting to see how Lion's Mane ranks subjectively compared to other purported nootropics, since comments may be systematically skewed for or against it. [In terms of overall pleasantness, anxiety, focus, memory, motivation and mood effects, lion's mane isn't close to being the best or the worst nootropic](https://darktka.github.io/). From my perspective Lion's Mane steals attention away from better nootropics because of the headline claim of increasing NGF, but it's not unique there, ALCAR also does the same thing [[5]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8187841), high quality research on Lion's mane is scarce and the subjective results on average are pretty underwhelming.

TL;DR

There's not enough research to make hard and fast recommendations about how much or what to take if you're interested in Lion's Mane. The safest bet is to eat the fruiting body (actual mushroom) or a powder from the fruiting body, which would mimic the protocol from the main Lion's mane study and its traditional use. But Lion's mane is confusing and there's a lot of false information and shady companies out there because the research is not conclusive, which is a problem in itself.

For an idea of what it would cost to eat 3 grams of dried lion's mane per day I looked what dried lion's mane was going for on the internet. I found a place that sells it for 33 dollars a pound, 1 pound has 453 grams. To replicate the study you'd need 3 grams per day, so that means that 33 dollars gives you a 151 day supply (about 5 months). 33/151 = 21 cents per day. It's actually an affordable experiment, if you're curious.

Uridine Monophosphate - A warning (May have destroyed my own brain),279,cgr1uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cgr1uo/uridine_monophosphate_a_warning_may_have/,179,1563907772.0,"Hey r/nootropics, long time lurker here. Just wanted to present a warning to others when it comes to supplementing Uridine Monophosphate.

As someone who has struggled severely with poor motivation, apathy and anergia, who comes from a familial background of underachievement, and who wished to avoid being trapped within that same cycle; I have like many on this sub-reddit experimented with supplementation, excercise and diet alteration seeking to ameliorate some of the seemingly hereditary performance inhibitors that have hampered my personal success and happiness.

So around the summer of 2018 I was set to begin a computer science course, and having browsed this sub-reddit came across threads discussing the therapeutic benefits of Uridine Monophosphate supplementation, and the reports appeared to be glowing. It seemed the perfect supplement to experiment with, with clinical trials seemingly supporting it's effectiveness in boosting cognition and motivation, promoting dopamine up-regulation, having positive cholinergic effects, with a strong safety profile.

And so, having acquired some in capsule form, I began supplementation, whilst I didn't have a source of Alpha-GPC, I ate a diet heavy in choline, to attempt to produce a similar effect.
And sufficed to say I noticed results quickly, I increased my daily dose from 350mg to 750mg orally , then from 175mg to 350mg sub-lingually, with entirely positive results, mood was enhanced significantly, my memory was notably enhanced, in particular long term recall and information encoding, my brain fog lifted, with complex problems now seeming trivial, I was far more confident in social situations and my work on my course was fantastic. In truth, it was a tremendous period of my life, full of passion and pleasure, and I felt as if I'd rediscovered my long lost childhood fervour for learning.

Eventually, having massively increased my workload, I dialled back the uridine supplementation, the gym work and the choline heavy diet, figuring that should my mood decline, I would return to my previous state, and pick the supplementation back up.
Eventually I ran out of my uridine supply, and opted not to purchase any more, frankly, I felt so changed as a person that a return to an altered mood state seemed impossible.

And that's when my problems began, it's somewhat of a horror story.

1) I noticed a decrease in my sleep time and quality, ascribing it to my heavy workload, I began a regime of increased sleep hygiene, to little effect.

2) I began to experience lethalogica, the ""tip of the tongue"" phenomenon, something I rarely experienced. It began infrequently, but soon occurred on several occasions per hour, my verbal fluency declined significantly, and it felt as if holes were being punched in my vocabulary.

3) Work I'd found easy just 6 weeks prior began to become difficult and intimidating.

4) My mood dropped, my passion diminished.

5) Suddenly I was struck by this seemingly pervasive processing deficiency, the world seemed to become ""flat"" and distant, the autonomic retrieval of information pertaining to objects seen the in the world seemed to dissappear.

6) I started to make simple mistakes, things such as not indicating whilst driving, I began to notice that I could no longer quickly verbally elucidate my thought processes whilst performing tasks like this, whereas previously I could do so comfortably.

7) I began suffering from an unrelenting fatigue that did not alleviate with sleep.

And then began the ""event"", the most awful and harrowing experience I have ever suffered and would not wish upon even the most despicable denizens of hell, I won't go into too much detail, but in short I was awake for six days, cycling between panicked excitability and an absolutely abject insufferable terror, which resulted in several trips to doctors, A&E and eventually  self imposed informal admission to psychiatric hospital. 

I was discharged on the 24th of December and have yet to make anything near a full recovery.

I no longer felt capable of completing my course, and eventually withdrew, and have been incapable of working since.

I suffer still from the persistent fatigue, my sleep is entirely unrefreshing, my brain is no longer functional in any real sense, I have fine movement tremors across my entire body, and feel some sort of jolting motion through my torso when I lie down. Whilst my doctors repeatadely insist I'm just ""depressed"" frankly I feel like I'm suffering from some sort of dementia.

Now I'm aware that all of these symptoms cannot be definitively demonstrated to be a result of the uridine supplementation and cessation, but the dramatic nature and short timescale of the alteration suggests a neurochemical effect.

Just thought I'd share my story.",2019-07-24 00:19:32

There are many supplements I swear by and take daily that have given me noticeable improvements like polygala, panax ginseng, black seed oil, ashwagandha, cordyceps, shilajit, noopept, piracetam, etc but a couple months ago I picked up cycling again after not being on a bike for over 2 years (partially due to a knee injury, partially just laziness) and although everyone knows how good cardio is for the brain it's often overlooked.

 It was tough at first and I found myself gasping for air and taking frequent breaks, but I persevered and after a couple weeks I started getting in better shape. I was amazed at how damn good I felt after cycling for 30 minutes to an hour. I get some euphoria, my mind speeds up and I obtain a clear headedness that beats any nootropic I've tried. The mild euphoria lasts for several hours and my brain just feels ""on"" for the rest of the day. 

I become more socially adept and confident partially due to the immediate benefits of exercise and partially due to getting in better shape and looking better over time. Now anytime I have something important coming up like a date, social event or even ranked MOBA gameplay I get my cycling in beforehand and it truly helps. I've also lost a considerable amount of weight, and through improving my diet and increasing my protein intake dramatically have gained muscle at the same time.

I know that L-Theanine doesn't work for everyone but if it does here's some information that may improve your experience.

&#x200B;

Current routine looks like this:

* 40-50mg L-Theanine + a double espresso + 2 cups of water in the morning. (Always drink water, you body and brain needs it!)
* No other nootropics/drugs, no alcohol

&#x200B;

Dosage effects:

* 40-50mg Gives me a good mood in the morning, i have patience with people and i can articulate myself better. That is because it makes me more calm and my mind is not racing.
* 100-150mg It acts more like a beta blocker as in more like an emotion suppressor. Personally i use only for public speaking which i hate but otherwise i avoid because of the ""zombie"" like feeling.
* 200mg+ Brain fog

&#x200B;

Side effects:

* Might lower your libido. Depending on the dosage.

&#x200B;

Notes:

* Taking L-Theanine before sleep or evening for that matter is a no-no. It may seem to help with sleep but it prevents you from going into deep sleep. At least that's my experience.
* No tolerance. Same effects every time.
* Too much = brain fog. Find how much your body can process.
* I use powder form, easier to control dosages.
* Empty stomach or not, makes no difference for me (true for powder form, pills might be different).

&#x200B;

Overall, i'd consider L-Theanine a great addition to your morning coffee routine. Benefits is that you get a nice calming effect that lasts almost all day.Not a medical opinion, but in higher dosages it might help with severe anxiety.",2019-07-14 08:37:56

During the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun.

f.lux fixes this: it makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day.

It's even possible that you're staying up too late because of your computer. You could use f.lux because it makes you sleep better, or you could just use it just because it makes your screen look better.

I have recently seen here people discussing whether it is safe or not to use BPC-157 eye drops. While there are no specific studies about it, it's important to remember BPC-157 is a very direct inducer of angiogenesis, and when it is applied locally to the eye it might cause excessive angiogenesis there that it wouldn't cause with other routes of administration.

Excessive angiogenesis in the eye can cause bleeding in the retina, which can lead to permanent, partial or complete, blindness^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12597922) . This is a known issue with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy).

This is much less of a concern, if any at all, when BPC-157 is administered orally or by a Sub-Q injection, since it shouldn't reach the eye in any significant concentrations to matter.

"A thorough review of NAC (N acetylcysteine), an over-the-counter antioxidant, in combatting cravings for cannabis and reducing compulsive cannabis use, as well as my anecdotal experience using the substance for this purpose for eight months now. Citations included in text.",276,c66ob9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/c66ob9/a_thorough_review_of_nac_n_acetylcysteine_an/,74,1561677000.0,"Like many others here, I have quit cannabis many times. More times than I can count, I’ve committed to abstaining from using cannabis, felt cravings and smoked up within a day, and felt a wave of almost-ashamed self-consciousness roll across my mind. 

The struggle is not quitting, but continuing to abstain, and the difficulty of this task lies in the circuitry of the human reward system. The frontal cortex, particularly the **prefrontal cortex** (referred to as the **PFC**) regulates emotional and hedonic impulses. The prefrontal cortices and the reward system — the **ventral tegementum** (referred to as the **VTA**) and the **nucleus accumbens** (referred to as the **NAc**)— are wired together in a loop of two-way communication. 

The **VTA** sends signals to the **PFC** through the **NAc** to remember sequences of behavior which produce positive or negative results, and the **PFC** can send signals back to the **NAc** and **VTA** to express the impulse and carry out the behavior, or to inhibit the impulse and leave the itch of desire unfulfilled (this is a simplistic description but adequate.) In addiction, from compulsive behaviors to drug addiction of all stripes, this pathway becomes altered. 

The **PFC**’s ability to inhibit reward pathways that have been very strongly reinforced, such as those fed by cannabis use, is lessened, creating the behavioral loop of wanting to stop, knowing you need to stop, but finding yourself unable to stop even when you try.

N-acetylcysteine is most widely known as an antioxidant, as it is a precursor to one of the body’s master antioxidants. It is the first-line treatment for acetaminophen/Tylenol overdose, as it is able to neutralize the toxic metabolites and protect the liver and organ systems from damage. 

In recent decades, research on NAC has revealed that it has very promising psychiatric effects as well. NAC has been demonstrated to have pronounced and varied benefits in a host of psychiatric and psychological conditions such as compulsive gambling, addiction, OCD, ADHD, bipolar disorders 1 and 2, schizophrenia, without demonstrable negative side effects or counter-indications. [N-acetylcysteine in psychiatry: current therapeutic evidence and potential mechanisms of action](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044191/)

The relevant effects of NAC on cannabis dependence are a result of its effects on a neurotransmitter called glutamate. While dopamine and other neurotransmitters flavor the messages of neurotransmission, glutamate is the ultimate messenger. NAC decreases glutamate activity in pathways between the **VTA** and **NAc** to the **PFC**, which results in pronounced reductions in craving and relapse behaviors. Where willpower fails, NAC can step in and create breathing room without creating further dependence to another drug.

The long-term benefits of NAC are concurrent to the short-term benefits. The reduction in **NAc**-**PFC** communication allows the heavily reinforced pathways to atrophy, freeing up the reward system’s capacity and allowing it to be diverted elsewhere towards healthier behaviors. Neurons that fire together wire together, and so pathways that have received a large amount of activity will be more heavily reinforced than others. Just as increased activity increases the strength of the pathway, reduced activity decreases the strength of the overactive pathways with time. 

The implications for us? NAC gives us breathing room in which to exercise our willpower and reinforce the behaviors we want to pursue to better ourselves, rather than the behaviors we are helpless to stop engaging in, such as cannabis use. Long-term NAC use will not only reduce cravings and relapse behaviors, but help normalize our reward system, and spread our reward capacity to the finer pleasures in life beyond the blunt instrument of cannabis use. 

The paper I cited even reviews a study of NAC’s use in cannabis dependence:

&amp;amp;gt;Marijuana dependence: A recent study by Gray and colleagues investigated the use of NAC (2400 mg/d) in an open-label study of 24 dependent marijuana users who reported an interest in reducing their use. Following treatment, users reported reductions in days/week of use and “number of hits.”

Here is another quote from the study mentioned:

&amp;amp;gt;N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reverse drug-induced down-regulation of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, which presumably allows for regulation of glutamate release, reducing compulsive drug-seeking be- haviors. Consistent with this, preliminary studies have demonstrated significant reductions in cocaine craving and cigarette use during NAC treatment. Taken together, these findings implicate NAC as a potential treatment for addictive disorders, including cannabis dependence. Thus, the purpose of this open-label study was to gather tolerability and preliminary efficacy data for NAC in the treatment of cannabis dependence in young people.

[N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) in Young Marijuana Users: An Open-Label Pilot Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2826714/)

There are other benefits. NAC has strong antioxidant activity, protecting mitochondria in the brain from toxic byproducts of metabolism, as well as pronounced anti-inflammatory activity in the body and brain, reducing the load of chronic inflammation from poor lifestyle and allergies. It is known that chronic inflammation alters dopamine activity in the reward system, negatively affecting willpower. With this in mind, the benefits of NAC are robust: it targets pathological coping mechanisms from multiple angles, and normalizes reward system activity to increase willpower and diminish cravings and compulsive behaviors such as cannabis use. 

[Can’t or Won’t? Immunometabolic Constraints on Dopaminergic Drive](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(19)30066-X)

NAC is a tool that has helped me, and it can certainly help many of you. I find that the constant itch of craving — for cannabis, and for other comforting coping mechanisms — gets quieter. Rather than becoming obsessed with hypotheticals to pursue pleasure, my mind is much more at ease with the novelties of the present moment. The breeze on my skin, the birds chirping, the rustling of branches and leaves in the forest have a magic that is easily forgotten, but similarly inviting to rediscover. When we can pull ourselves away from the cycle of craving and satiation of dependence on cannabis or any other source of comfort for that matter, we are able to re-enter the present and rediscover what we knew as kids.

I take three 600 milligram tablets of sustained-release NAC first thing in the morning. I feel the clarity and coolness come on within half an hour, and it lasts for the entire day with this dose. I felt this effect the first time I used this dosage of NAC, back in October of 2018, and I still feel the same effect today. While my use has shifted away from cannabis abstinence as I’ve recovered, I find that it helps address my anxiety, ADHD, and residual post-concussion symptom symptoms, which greatly increases my quality of life. 

For context, I’m an eighteen year old guy who has had difficulty with anxiety, ADHD, and compulsive reward behavior all my life, and in the past four years since I discovered cannabis, I have struggled to moderate myself and remain stable, especially after the string of six concussions I received, the last nearly a year ago. NAC and other supplements, alongside weekly therapy and a wholesale-healthy lifestyle, have helped nurse me back to health, and given me the strength and support I needed to thrive.

I use the Whole Foods brand ($20 for 100 tablets, $.20/tablet) because it is most convenient for me, but Jarrow’s NAC sustained release ($18.17 for 100 tablets, $.18/tablet) is of comparable or even better quality at a better price point. 

I hope this helps someone out there in some way. Cheers! :)

Edit: An important note that has been made in the comments that I must add:

While NAC has certainly contributed to a number of positive changes in my life, **it has not been the sole factor.** I’ve had the support of a psychiatrist who knows me and my conditions very well and with whom I research and discuss the mechanisms underlying my various conditions as well as the different pharmacotherapies, prescription and OTC/supplemental, which are available and show promise. I’ve also had the support and guidance of a therapist with whom I have worked for more than sixteen months now. Nothing is an instant fix, certainly. Take my experience with a grain of salt, reader, as our situations most certainly vary. I am also 18, and have had a strong emotional attachment to my health and well-being, so my perspective is definitely myopic in some regards.",2019-06-28 04:40:00

Struggling with brainfog/depression/anxiety? Succes story (long post),271,brc8wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/brc8wz/struggling_with_brainfogdepressionanxiety_succes/,162,1558483638.0,"This community here on reddit is amazing and I would like to say 'thank You' by sharing my story and hopefully my experience will help other people.

I'm an 18 year old guy, one of my nr 1 'life rules' has been to be healthy, both in diet and physically (since I was 12 year old). My diet has been extremely clean for the past few years and I do calisthenics (bodyweight workouts) on daily basis.

Although my diet was great and I always looked strong and healthy.. I had some serious issues with my mental health (cognitive function) pretty much ever since I entered the puberty. 

I didn't had any traumatic experience when I was young or negative thoughts that led me to depression.. 

This brainfog was a mix of uncontrolled depression and anxiety that was always present in my life (started when I was 14).. but every year, I would get a 'season' of extreme depression and extreme anxiety which often led me to stay in bed for weeks or even months.

This seasonal crap didn't happened just in winter or just in summer (it wasn't a seasonal depression), it happened at ANY time and could last throughout the whole summer till winter or even longer. 

After a while.. I seriously started to worry. I have a girlfriend and we plan to have a future together and I just COULDN'T feel this way anymore..

My symptoms were: anxiety, chronic fatigue, depression, mood swing, sensitivity to pain/light/loud sounds, no libido.. one word: HELL

I would never end my life.. but after experiencing this.. I understood why some people do 

It felt as if my body or brain couldn't handle life anymore.. while I am truly one of the luckiest people alive.. I have a great/supportive family, an amazing girlfriend (soon wife), great plans for the future, ALWAYS been full of joy and optimism..

But I was literally dying inside. 

I decided that this is it, I won't give up on life without fighting for it.. 

I visited waaaay too many doctors.. who took blood tests (for everything) that always came back perfect. They said that I 'stress too much about my brainfog.. which just makes it even worse'.. they recommended me to practice some meditation and yoga (great tip)... that's exactly what I wanted and needed to hear at the darkest times of my life. 

I took things into my own hands, didn't gave a sht about doctors and started to look into /nootropics on reddit, herbs and natural supplements 

I started to see some light on the end of the dark tunnel that I've been in for sooo long. I started to read people's experiences EVERY day (it became my new hobby) and I ordered some suplements. 

I bought:
- Magnesium (mineral) 
- Black seed oil (seed oil) 
- Ashwagandha (herb/root powder) 
- Rhodiola Rosea (herb/root powder) 

This is how I'm feeling after about JUST 2 weeks of supplementing:

- energy improved, I sleep MUCH less and feel amazing 
- no more depression 
- no more brainfog/memory/focus issues 
- anxiety.. GONE 
- great mood throughout the whole day 
- my social life improved DRASTICALLY.. due to my new mental clarity, better memory and focus
- I'm stable, feeling grounded and confident af
- my libido is through the roof (probably due to the ashwagandha).. me and my girl have had so much fun lately 

I went from a zombie to a freaking superman!!!! 

I'm not PROMOTING ANYTHING 

It's UNBELIEVABLE how I feel now.. maybe it was just a magnesium deficiency or maybe the black seed oil known for 'cure for everything except death' healed something that my doctors couldn't diagnose.. 

Anyways.. this stuff is amazing and everyone who's struggling with mental health for no known reasons, should REALLY consider trying these amazing supplements 

I just want to thank YOU all the people here on this community and I would be sooo happy if someone else could fix things they struggle with on daily basis like I did..

My daily doses:
- Magnesium: 1250mg a day
- Black seed oil: 3g in the morning and 3g in the evening 
- Ashwagandha (root powder): 4,5g in the morning 
- Rhodiola Rosea (root powder): 500/1000mg a day 

If You have any questions.. feel open to ask about anything and good luck on Your journey to a better, healthier and happier life.

Edit:
I see many people mention here bipolar disorder, mania etc.. You need to understand that I'm not feeling like I'm high on some drugs, I'm feeling like I'm back to my NORMALSELF. This is how every other 18 year old should feel like.. mental clarity and feeling energetic. It's like being an 80 year old grandpa (I literally felt like that) and going back to youth where u had energy to be outside all day long.. 

Thank u for all the support tho!!",2019-05-22 05:37:18

Out of all the energy drinks, Red Bull seems to be the only one that actually makes me feel alright. I started going through the ingredients, trying them on their own and eventually, I worked my way up to freaking baking soda. I've been taking a little arm & hammer box with me to work daily and I just took 2 teaspoons with some water. My brain fog feels like it's melting away and I can focus much easier. Almost every day 3ish hours after lunch I experience intense brain fog and anxiety and it helps eat through that as well (a real game-changer)

From what I've read, sodium bicarbonate can help correct the lower pH in blood from your body's byproducts such as lactic acid buildup from exercise leading to increased performance, or even ketones from burning excessive fat. Speaking of ketones, MCT oil used to give me the WORST crippling brain fog. If I take a teaspoon of baking soda along with the MCT oil I get NO FOG whatsoever and it actually works intended. 

I'm actually a little concerned that this may be indicative of a disorder I've got going on, but I can't narrow it down to anything. Is it's effectiveness something I need to be worried about?",2019-11-23 04:40:18

ALCAR (Acetyl L-Carnitine) and the NMDA receptor; Memory problems and Marijuana abuse,269,a1xpx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a1xpx2/alcar_acetyl_lcarnitine_and_the_nmda_receptor/,84,1543649593.0,"I've just discovered some information that I think is valuable enough to share, specifically if you are concerned about the memory problems you're experiencing due to chronic marijuana use/abuse. The mechanism by which chronic marijuana use causes memory problems is the internalization of the CB1 receptor, the same mechanism which causes tolerance to marijuana in the first place. When the CB1 receptor is internalized into the cell, other receptors associated with it will follow, most notably the NMDA receptor, and while these receptors are in the cell they are unable to carry out functions associated with their activation (These are proven and real effects, read more here https://examine.com/nutrition/the-unbiased-truth-about-marijuana/). When it comes to memory problems, this internalization of the NMDA receptor is extremely important. It is known that there is an overall decrease in NMDA receptors as people age, and lower NMDA receptor levels have been implicated in hindering memory function, learning ability, and synaptic plasticity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703758/). NMDA receptor dysfunction/loss is found to a high degree in Alzheimer's patients.

Here's where the role of Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR) comes in. I found several studies that document an increase in NMDA receptors in the brain following ALCAR treatments. 
>Acute i.p. administration of Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR), a component of several biological systems, has been found to modify spontaneous and evoked electrocortical activity in young rats, and, in the old rats, to improve learning ability and to **increase the number of NMDA receptors in the whole brain.**

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7969747/

>Aging is associated with a reduction in the maximal density of NMDA-sensitive glutamate binding sites in rat hippocampus. This reduction is attenuated after long-term administration with L-acetylcarnitine (10 mg/Kg i.p. once a day for 4 months)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2557734/?i=3&from=/7969747/related

Now, if you're like me and you find yourself addicted to lots of weed (or maybe you smoke every day but you can stop whenever you want, whatever), and you're starting to experience undeniable and unignorable memory deficits, this data seems to indicate that ALCAR can solve the memory issues caused by NMDA receptor internalization, by either increasing total number of NMDA receptors, attenuating their decline caused by excessive marijuana use, or both. I'm interested to see feedback on this information, personally I've been taking ALCAR for a few days and aside from the increases in attention and energy I'm seeing a noticable benefit in long and short term memory, the latter of which has seen a much more drastic increase, while cutting my marijuana consumption by about a third.",2018-12-01 13:03:13

Caffine + L-theanine is absolutely magical for me. What could I do to try and bring my baseline nearer to it?,264,fpvg94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fpvg94/caffine_ltheanine_is_absolutely_magical_for_me/,143,1585337918.0,"Hi!

I'm once again struck by just how phenomnenally effective this combo is for me - I try not to drink coffee too often lest I grow a tolerance to it, but whenever I do the wave of optimism, focus, and productivity astounds me. It is a telling anecdote that the morning went by largely unnoticed, spent mostly drifting in thought or on the internet intermixed with a couple spurts of activity, and that fifteen minutes after drinking a shot of espresso mixed with half a gram of l-theanine (a fifteen minutes that went by very much lost in thought, unaware, basically forgetting I had even drank it) I found myself cleaning the kitchen, buzzed about the various things I am making progress on in life.

My lifestyle is semi sedentary, I have a pretty solid mindfulness habit, and I eat a fairly varied diet with a strong sleeping schedule that ensures 8 hours of rest each day.

Yet, without caffeine, I struggle significantly from a general lack of... energy, motion, momentum. Getting going is hard, sustaining movement is far from effortless, and stopping is easy.

What would be the lowest hanging fruit in terms of getting even a bit closer to the caffeine high in my normal life? Should I just embrace caffeine further (as I recall some effects one does not grow a tolerance to), explore some of the caffeine alternatives, increase exercise or try something else? Very open to advice or general discussion on the topic, as this ""lack of energy"" is very much the biggest challenge I grapple with each day - and undoubtedly one some others here will relate to also.

&#x200B;

Gathering some of the common themes from the replies below:

1. Get moving, you lazy bum!- various theories as to why, from dopamine upregulation to tricking your body into believing higher energy levels are necessary to more abstract ideas around ""staying in motion""< Yup, I probably should. I have tried a few times in the past, but the energy slump I experience a few minutes after execise makes it very hard to really ""snowball"" the habit in a meaningful way.
2. Meditate the tiredness awayOn it, about 20min a day is my norm.
3. Nature, baby!< I go for a walk almost every day, about 15-30 minutes long, in a forest nearby. I enjoy it, it's partly an additional mindfulness exercise for me as well, but the same slump as from exercise hits about as soon as I get indoors.
4. Supplements - it's turtles all the way down! :D- I knew the subreddit I was posting this in, so no surprises here.
5. Quite a few people suggest switching away from coffee to some other caffeinated herb - must say I don't fully understand why. I sometimes drink coffee, other times I drink (lots of) tea or mate. The effects seem very similar to me.
6. Uridine is something I am right now trialling, with no clear effect so far.
7. One person noted it could be a norepinephrine issue, which in some ways resonates with me - I definitely enjoy being near deadlines, the tiredness just melts away. So far I've just not found any replacement for deadlines :D.
8. Caffeine dependence is something many suggest or imply as a problem. Been through a 2-week reset, now taking less than 200mg/week, concentrated on one or two days. So I'm not exactly guzzling the stuff.
9. A couple voices suggest just giving in to caffeine dependence, that it does retain some of its effects. It frustrates me that info on caffeine tolerance is so scarce, despite it being something that should surely be impacting almost all of us - afterall, caffeine is the one nootropic that almost everyone agrees genuinely, tangibly works.
10. One person noted that this could be a case of undiagnosed adult ADHD, which definitely felt counterintuitive at first. However, upon closer examination (and time taken to get past the popular idea of what the disorder is) this could indeed be more of a symptom of inhibition control: following impulses and stimuli, struggling to orient one's behaviour towards distinct goals (in my above description, ""morning went by largely unnoticed, spent mostly drifting in thought or on the internet""). A number of other possible signs are there, so I've made an appointment with a neurologist who specialises in adult ADHD to explore this avenue as well. Can't hurt.

I'm the laziest man alive when I don't take anything,266,d26yln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d26yln/im_the_laziest_man_alive_when_i_dont_take_anything/,220,1568147931.0,"I'm probably exaggerating it, but my whole life I have been lazy as fuck. I have no work ethic, I do the absolute least possible on everything I can. I just finished my master in computer science and I gained no work ethic at all from it.

I don't think I'm depressed, I'm quite happy most of the time, I'm also super shy but I become super happy and sociable when I'm drunk, my friends appreciate that about me but I always wanted to be more productive and sociable in my normal life.

Well a few years ago I discovered modafinil and I bought some online, it actually worked a bit but I wasn't spending time on the right thing, it would make me compare every laptop possible to see what's the best one at each price point or some other shit like that for hours instead of making me study more so I stopped taking it.

Recently I had accumulated so much thing to do, my apartment was a total mess, I didn't take out the trash for months, I couldn't even go on my balcony anymore, I was literally losing money because I was too lazy to cancel some subscriptions and I ghosted some interviewers for jobs I wanted to do and many other things.

At this point, I decided to take one artvigil with one pill of caffeine which I read was a good combination. Well I'm happy I did that because I had the most productive day of my whole life, my apartment is spotless, I did everything I should have done for months in only one day, I actually called to cancel my old internet subscription without being stressed, (for me calling is the worst, it makes me stressed as fuck and I have to prepare mentally for hours or days, well not this time)

The only problem is that when I'm under the effect of artvigil (and caffeine this time) I lose one trait of my personality that I like, I'm the least stressed person ever, nothing stress me (except calling or meeting someone I don't know) and my days are peaceful. Under the effect I can feel my body being a lot more twitchy, I don't know how to explain it but I need to do something and sometimes it's annoying but I like everything else, my mind is also a lot less heavy and I just do things without thinking too much about it.

Also when I'm not under the effect, I think about writing stuff like that on reddit but I never do it, now I'm under the effect for an other productive day and I'm finally motivated enough to write that down, I don't really mind if nobody reply to this post but I needed to write it for a long time, I have more to tell but I don't want this post to be too long.

If you have a similar story or if you want to comment about something I would be more than happy to exchange with you.

Thank you for reading.

Edit : I didn't expect so much replies, I'm quite happy that I can relate to some of you (and that some of you can relate to me), I never talk about that type of things with anyone. Sorry if I didn't reply yet to you, it's quite a lot to read and I also try to be productive with other things at the same time :) Thank you all!",2019-09-11 02:08:51

I thought I would share my experience with nicotine as a nootropic to hopefully help save others similar to myself from wasting their time (in more than a few ways).

**TL;DR/Take home message:** If you have even the tiniest bit of an addictive personality, then I'd strongly advise staying away from nicotine entirely. It's a powerful drug and should be treated as such. If you're going to try it anyway then I'd recommend to reserve it for very occasional use; once a week tops. I'd had much better improvements in cognition, motivation, conscientiousness and even mornings with meditation, exercise and a good diet than I've had with this. If you do/can use it very occasionally as a nootropic, then good for you; my experience is that it made things worse. The articles, top 10 nootropic lists, etc. I'd read before did mention the addictive nature of it, but I thought I'd be ok. They DID NOT mention increases in impulsivity re: using nicotine; this increased impulsivity negated any gains.

**Starting**  
I had stopped smoking about 12 years ago. About 1.5 years ago I had a resurgent interest in nootropics. Looking through a few web articles, many of them recommended nicotine. I'd stopped years ago due to health concerns and the lack of nicotine replacement options, so thought I might give it a try. My initial intention was to use it for productivity, to help with reading/writing/academia.

**Initial** **Use**  
Initial findings were understandably/obviously pleasant (due to the highly dopaminergic nature of the drug). I was only using occasionally (keeping to initial intention). I'd use a mouth spray. Occasionally turned into regularly: a few in the morning, then after meals, and more in the evening if I was having a drink. I've alway struggled with mornings, and this was one of the first times I felt there was a quick fix for that morning grogginess.

**Escalation**  
Usage escalated very quickly to the point where I was using the mouth spray around the clock. Further, it meant that 1 glass of wine in the evening turned into 2, and sometimes 3, because the pairing of depressant and stimulant of the two was so enjoyable; more drinking meant more nicotine, etc.

**Quitting**  
Not only was I NOT more productive re: nicotine, I was actually LESS productive and more impulsive. Whatever gains I was getting re: dopamine/motivation and acetylcholine/cognition were hugely impaired by increasing impulsivity, etc (backed up by studies below). That, and I was drinking more. So, I decided to quit.

**Nicotine and Impulsivity**  
""Nicotine increases impulsivity and decreases willingness to exert cognitive effort despite improving attention in ""slacker"" rats"" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25353339](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25353339)""Exposure to nicotine vapor causes short-term increases in impulsive choice in rats""[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/842005v2.full](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/842005v2.full)""Effects of acute and chronic nicotine on impulsive choice in rats""[https://insights.ovid.com/behavioural-pharmacology/bepha/2005/02/000/effects-acute-chronic-nicotine-impulsive-choice/2/00008877](https://insights.ovid.com/behavioural-pharmacology/bepha/2005/02/000/effects-acute-chronic-nicotine-impulsive-choice/2/00008877)

Quitting was hell, which I guess makes sense going from using something around the clock to stopping entirely. The time I've lost re: nicotine: lost productivity due to increased impulsivity; weeks out of my schedule due to quitting down time. Save yourself the trouble and don't start.",2020-02-22 10:38:16
Experiments without a doctor are dangerous. My friend killed himself,261,6hz0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6hz0mg/experiments_without_a_doctor_are_dangerous_my/,121,1497810708.0,"I had a best friend, we talked with him every day for 9 years. /user/BerserkerGreaves/


We have always had a mild depression, but last year it has intensified. However, the reason for each was different. I have brain damage. He lacks a girl, few friends, problems with his family, migraine, a bad city of habitation and other. We both found this sub on the reddit and began to try the substances to help ourselves.


He tried everything, even microdosing. He also drank antidepressants and I constantly said that he should discuss everything with the doctor. 3 days ago in the evening he said that he had completely cured depression and that there had never been such a condition, he had many plans for future. And in the morning of next day he wrote a farewell letter, swallowed all the pills and died from cardiac arrest.


I feel guilty and will never be able to forgive myself.
With this theme I wanted to say that it's very dangerous to drink drugs without a doctor. I also note that in this subreddit, more depression is treated than cognitive problems, but cure depression without a doctor is too dangerous.
Discuss, please, all with the physician.

Most of us have taken Tianeptine. Some of us rely on it to function in our social, educational, and professional careers. We know the profound effect it can have on individuals. We would never want it to be banned. I would be mortified if it were banned. I personally do not know what I what do. 
 
 Kratom is a similar substance. It hits the mu-opioid receptors. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people rely on it everyday just like they do on tianeptine. Personally I notice very little difference between these two substances except for the duration of effect. Ceretropics sulphate version is longer.

Threats from Brainstorm Nootropics / PowerFocus,250,4nnf61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4nnf61/threats_from_brainstorm_nootropics_powerfocus/,94,1465710515.0,"Some of you may have seen the new vendor post about a week ago for a new product called PowerFocus, from Brainpower Nootropics . The owner has deleted it now, but you can see the comments in the link below; minus the comments from the owner, which have either been edited or deleted.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4m6mpf/feedback_on_this_nootropic/

Now many of you know that I can be very critical of new companies that pop up with unfounded claims, over the top marketing, fake reviews, no purity testing, dangerous ingredients, etc. Lately others have been starting to jump in and question things too, which is a good thing. It shows that people are starting to push for higher standards in the industry. Admittedly, I can be a bit direct in some of my criticisms. Some may even call me an asshole. However, I do it because I care about the community and the people in it. The fact that it seems like a new company selling a nootropic stack pops up every week, makes these criticisms more frequent. I want this community to be safer, grow, and advance. New vendors creating quality products, doing proper testing, and not over-marketing the shit out of things, is the way to do that. We have some really good vendors, that bring out novel quality products, and treat safety the way it should be treated. But like any other growing industry, we have a ton of people getting into it just to make money. Those are the ones that need to be called out.

Now to the direct issue of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus. Their stack was called out by a few people for a number of reasons. The most glaring of them is the fact that they claim to have almost 3 grams powders per serving, but you cannot physically fit that amount into two 00 capsules. Anybody that works with 00 capsules can immediately know something is up with those numbers. They also did not know what a COA was when asked, along with a few other issues. All very valid things to call a vendor out on. The big issue, and the reason I made this post, is that after those criticisms were raised, the owner of the company decided to threaten me with retribution if I did not delete my comments. This is a very serious issue, and needs to be addressed.

I've been threatened a few times now by other vendors, and some have even followed through on those threats, and have caused issues for me. It happens to me a lot because of how vocal I am about ridiculous things I see, and the fact that I am an easier target to lash out at. However, nobody should fear retribution from vendors for calling them out on things they see wrong. Vendors threatening any members of this community is unacceptable, but it is more common than many think. Other moderators have been threatened. Other Redditors have as well. It something that needs to be addressed. I'll provide evidence of Brainpower Nootropics/PowerFocus's threats below, along with evidence of him following through with those threats.

[Here is the email we received from the owner of Brainpower Nootropics yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/suFrK7f.jpg)

[Here is the Facebook message threat sent around the same time.](http://i.imgur.com/inM7RNW.jpg)

Apparently someone made a bad review of their product on Amazon after their launch post, and he thought it was me. It's obviously not me, but he felt it necessary to threaten me all the same. At first I just decided to ignore it. I thought he would drop it after he vented his frustration with his little idle threat, and that would be it. However, then he decided to step the game up to libel and defamation, by writing a review on our Facebook wall saying that he almost died from one of our products. That took it from an idle threat, to an actual crime. 

[Here is his ""review"" on our page.](http://i.imgur.com/SAubiEg.jpg)

This is obviously unacceptable, and I will be contacting the Leeds police department in the UK to discuss it with them. UK libel and defamation laws are a lot more strict, and him using his real personal Facebook page makes it pretty easy to link. Making fake reviews, of almost dying no less, is not just something that the community cannot tolerate. It is an actual crime. To be clear, we will not accept vendors threatening anyone for expressing their opinions on this forum, nor anyone making threats of any kind. If a vendor threatens you, please contact us moderators, and we will help deal with it.

But the results have been so stunning I couldn't wait.

I came to Semax after [reading this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/b603zg/what_semax_did_for_me/?st=jvi65pk9&sh=9b146327) 

I'm 16 months clean from hard drugs and six months clean and sober. I've meditated, exercised, eaten well, worked the steps, volunteered, gotten into therapy... done everything you're supposed to do in recovery. But Semax is the only thing that's worked for me for anxiety, low mood, and anhedonia. Here is my log:

------------------
SEMAX LOG
Day 0:
I score 12 points on the depression self assessment and 11 points on the anxiety self assessment.
I am often tired, depressed and anxious. On weekends I sleep 14-18 hours a day. I have lots of trouble enjoying things I used to enjoy before I entered recovery (art, music, movies, writing, volunteering).
I have issues with crowds and worrying and am definitely ANHEDONIC. It’s been over 15 months without drugs at this point.

Day 1:
Last night I took 1,000 mcg of semax when I got home. 500mcg or 3ml drop of 1% solution in each nostril. 
I was surprised to feel effects almost immediately, with the “fog” leaving me and a focus settling in.
I wouldn’t call that a high but a general feeling of calm, control and wellbeing.
I usually have tons of issues sleeping but I went to bed at 10 last night and woke up at 750. No issues. I feel rested. Still in a good mood.
Think this is a good sign.

Day 2:
Yesterday was such a good day. I think I felt joy for the first time in recovery while I was alone. 
I was at the supermarket eating some chicken, spinach and quinoa and there just-so-happened to be a full brass band playing. During their final song the tubas made a series of melancholy major and minor chords that almost made me tear up.
Definitely made me joyful.
Also – I did so much stuff yesterday:

•	Put away my suitcase

•	Put away my clean clothes

•	Brushed/flossed/mouthwashed twice

•	Emailed two personal trainers

•	Gymed

•	Went grocery shopping

•	Worked on my freelance job and my day job

•	Volunteered at the animal shelter

•	Changed the air filter on the air conditioner

•	Ate 3 healthy meals

•	Tried meditating (for 2 minutes but still)

•	Did this log
I took another 1000mcg today. We’ll see how work is with semax.

Day 3:
I ended up taking 1500 mcg of semax yesterday. It was good, not as good as Sunday but what work day is.
I’m starting to think that semax doesn’t guarantee joy but unlocks the possibility of it
For sure Mondays at my work are stressful and I’m usually spiraling by 2pm.
That did not happen yesterday, I felt some concern, sure but nothing I couldn’t handle.
After work yesterday I booked a personal training session and also walked dogs and went to a recovery meeting.
Here’s to another day.

Day 4:
Yesterday was another good day, very productive day at work. Wrote a training module for new hires that was complicated. Nailed it on the first go.
Took ~2000mcg of semax yesterday (I think).
Met up with a friend for jazz and saw the personal trainer and then cooked myself a nice healthy meal.
No feelings of anhedonia or depression on anxiety like I was feeling.
Negatives: semax at this dose definitely causes headaches late in the day.

Day 5:
It’s the end of my work day and I handled another busy day OK.
Not bursting with joy and good feelings like I was last time but still handling things very well.
Probably just low sleep last night because I went to the movies.
There is definitely a new depth to things there wasn’t before.
I’m able to solve problems with ease and communicate better.
I can interact with other without being wracked by anxiety.
I listen to music and am able to appreciate it creatively and emotionally instead of just mechanically.
I feel like I’m returning to my old self.

Day 6:
I retook the depression and anxiety questionnaire today.
I got a 2 depression score and a 2 anxiety score.
I’m a bit flabbergasted. I know this isn’t the most scientific way to measure the efficacy of semax but holy shit.
I feel like I have a new grit and a new resilience that is allowing me to tackle the days issue without having a breakdown.
And a new perspective that allows me to be able to experience joy, real joy, even if every day isn’t joyful.
Things are good 😊",2019-05-11 03:53:27

It was a complication from having an overactive thyroid (t4 was over 160) and a bladder infection. His elevated BP helped push a blood clot into his brain. 

He couldn't walk at all - he'd fall over with each step and be confused what just happened, but he still tried to get to the food bowl and cat litter and use them.

My awesome vet helped with the thyroid, blood pressure and bladder infection but there was not really anything available to help with the stroke recovery.

I remembered that noopept (GVS-111) was originally designed to treat ischaemia / stroke and other brain injuries and I still had a bottle lying around from a couple of years ago. Seemed like it would be worth a shot? My vet was cautious, but open to anything that might make a difference.

I used the allometric scaling calculator to arrive at a 3mg/day dose schedule. With the help of some small syringes (no tip), I suspended noopept in water and gave him daily oral doses. It was important to start as soon as possible.

By day 3, he was staggering like a drunken sailor, but not falling over. At day 6, he was walking in straight lines and had 90% of his motor function back - he just behaved like a typical older cat.

At 2 weeks, he is not just normal again - he is considerably healthier, happier and more active than he has been for 2 years and thanks to the other medication, he has been putting weight back on again.

Animals are surprisingly resilient, but everyone involved has found this to be rather amazing.

Maybe this story will help someone else, so I thought I'd share.",2016-04-16 11:43:35

However, the studies on the benefits of eating fish are plentiful.

 https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/fish-as-brain-food/

>Researchers analyzed data from 260 cognitively normal people, average age 78, who had answered diet questionnaires. They’d also had their blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids measured and their brains scanned.

>The researchers found that ***weekly consumption of baked or broiled fish — but not fried fish — was associated with larger gray matter volumes in areas of the brain responsible for memory and cognition, including areas where amyloid plaques, a sign of Alzheimer’s disease, first appear.*** The association persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, education, physical activity, body mass index and any tissue damage found on the initial magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain.

>The ***results were the same regardless of omega-3 levels***, suggesting that omega-3s were not the determining factor. The study appears in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

So its not the DHA, its something else in fish that boosts gray matter. What? I don't know, no one fucking knows. So now I just eat fish.

Sardines are awesome because they are high in healthy fat, but they store well and are easy to eat. Salmon and tuna are out for me due to mercury issues. Mackerel is good too but hard to find for me. 

Down side to sardines - maybe they don't taste amazing. 

So I messed around and here is how to make sardines delicious. 

Hot Sauce 

Mustard

Thats it! thats the secret. Mash up the sardines on a plate, pour liberal amount of mustard and some hot sause, mix thoroughly so it gets all up in there. Then I like to put that on a cracker or some blue corn chips. Honestly delicious. Takes all the fishy taste right out. I actually look forward to it. A nice green salad goes perfect with it, very healthy. 

So there you go. Try it.",2019-11-20 15:27:49

I assume this is due to to the cortisol spike causing a more scatter-brained state of mind and that makes quite a bit of sense.

Caffeine is... more interesting than I thought.,246,cbh8mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cbh8mm/caffeine_is_more_interesting_than_i_thought/,192,1562796915.0,"Long story short and correcting for all other lifestyle changes, experienced a very slow onset of depression like symptoms over the course of a year. Looking back, it started when my favorite diet soda halved its caffeine content, for some reason I drank them less. I then switched to water and also stopped drinking green tea at night because I hadn't had Gatorade in a long time and switched. Halved my morning coffee intake as well just to use less. I went from ~250mg caffeine daily to ~40mg. This wasn't a conscious attempt to quit, I just slowly replaced the drinks and could not pinpoint my lack of motivation, extreme boredom, and zero interest in anything which compounded to slowly lead me into a depressed state.


Turns out:

[Chronic caffeine alters the density of adenosine, adrenergic, cholinergic, GABA, and serotonin receptors and calcium channels in mouse brain](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00733753)

Caffeine blocks the release (or alters turnover) of serotonin, dopamine, and excites glutamate and norepinephrine. Leading you to less of the former and more of the latter. Pre-tolerance.

Yet also [increases serotonin by 26-30% and GABA by 65%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3437321/) post-tolerance, as the brain tries to overcompensate for the caffeine.

Edit: Dopamine may not be compensated for, but it is often given too much credit in terms of mood anyway.

It would appear acute withdrawal from caffeine (breaks between drinks with chronic use/tolerance) lends you to a desirable baseline in terms of mood. **Through overcompensation of the *negatives* of adenosine, you have dopamine and serotonin suppression causing them to sensitize, and through elevated levels of glutamate your mind counter balances by sensitizing GABA, and finally elevated norepinephrine once again overcompensates.**

*Acute withdrawals essentially act as an anti depressant and anxiolytic by making you more sensitive to baseline levels of the above?* This would make sense as for many caffeine puts them in an undesirable state in favor of waking themselves up. Hence the avoidance of caffeine by many once they feel awake.

Post acute withdraws after fully quitting would begin to become negative as your body reverses these sensitizations. 
___________

**TL;DR/ELI5** Caffeine blocks happy feelings and makes you jittery, over time your body compensates by making itself more sensitive to happy and calm feelings.

Once caffeine is out of your system (but you are still a chronic user), your normal levels of happy production return, but your brain is still more sensitive. End result is a better mood than normal. You do not gain a tolerance in the typical sense because this better mood *is* the tolerance. It is your body tolerating the bad brought on by caffeine (which is masked by the acute boost in norepinephrine).

 
If I am wrong about anything please let me know, but what is the general consensus on caffeine as a nootropic?

Edit: **Acute withdrawals** is time between dosing, NOT quitting. I am not proposing you get a mood boost from constantly getting addicted to and then quitting caffeine. Simply stating it appears that caffeine continues to boost your mood above baseline even when not being actively consumed.",2019-07-11 03:45:15

That changes when I smoke pot. It's like my prefrontal cortex turns on again, and I can lift my head up and perceive the world again, and see how impoverished my internal life normally is. The problem is that it also makes me high, so I can't go about my life that way, and I only smoke once a week or so on average.

I would give anything to figure out why marijuana has this effect, so that I could attempt to imitate it with a substance that doesn't make me high. Anyone have thoughts?

CBD oil doesn't have this effect, nor do any of the dozens of supplements I've tried over the years, from bacopa to piracetam to curcumin.

## Introduction (feel free to skip) :

Some here may know me for my in-depth research regarding the topic of GABA based anxiolytics. I have researched regarding GABAergics that does not cause tolerance and down-regulation of GABAA receptors, and I have papers in this field on PubMed. My drive for learning this topic and sharing is due to some personal reasons.

## Common misconceptions regarding GABA A Receptor

Most GABAA positive allosteric modulators(PAM or PAMs), are actually agonists at the benzodiazepine site. Benzodiazepine site itself is a modulatory site of the GABAA receptor's chloride ion channel. Diazepam, for example, commonly known as valium, act as an agonist at the benzodiazepine site, which in return, ups the efficacy of chloride ion uptake. Ashwagandha, skullcap, and most herbal anxiolytics are believed to perform as a benzodiazepine partial agonist.


Direct agonist of GABAA receptors are rare, and they usually induce tolerance and dependence faster than benzodiazepines.
So does benzodiazepine agonist or partial agonists = GABAA PAM, yes you can understand it that way. However another misconception is that benzodiazepine antogonists such as flumazenil are stimulatory. No. An antagonist of a modulatory site means that the modulatory site loses its ability at modulating the modulated receptor.

Another misconception, **arent all benzodiazepines or GABAergics addictive? No,** It depends on the GABAA subunit binding profile of the specific benzodiazepine agonist interact with. Kava and many specific benzodiazepines have shown promise at being anxiolytics without impairing cognition / building tolerance.

Subunits:

- a1 Subunit. Recent research have shown that GABAA a1 to be the most addictive and tolerance building subunit. It leads the tolerance effect as a1 was found to be the subunit where agonists produce most of the downstream changes to your benzodiazepine receptors. a1 is also being the cognitive impairing, sedating, and memory worsening subunit. This means that drugs that avoid this receptor produces no sedating, memory impairing, tolerance, withdrawal, and abuse potential.

- a2 and a3 Subunits. a2 a3 selective agonists have shown to have significantly reduced abuse potential, with their main effects at reducing anxiety and promoting muscle relaxation. 

- a5 subunit is involved in memory, agonist has shown memory impairments while inverse agonists have shown memory enhancement.

This beautiful profile of GABAA a1, a2, a3, and a5 subunit brings a new era of pharmacology where anxiolytics with almost no abuse potential and tolerance is possible. A grand table of what effects GABAA a1, a2, a3, a5 subunits are responsible for in terms of their neuropharmacological profile, [please see table 1 in this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973310/pdf/ndt-14-1351.pdf)

*Just to be scientifically accurate, even subunits can be further categorized, such as: a1b2g2, a1b3g2 and a1b2g3, etc. However for the sake of this piece being understandable as well as lack of research in these further sub-categories, we will not talk about it more. Is it possible that 1 of these specific a1 subunits contribute more specific effects than another and therefore we can have 2 drug that are both a1 subunit agonist that produce different rate of sedation, tolerance building, etc.*


## Complete List (Pharmaceuticals):

- [Imidazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil), One of the most promising benzodiazepines in animal studies that have no human studies yet. It is a GABAA a2,a3 Partial agonist, weak to none a1,a4,a5 activities. Zero tolerance building in [monkeys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11224341) and [rat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8013567) studies when chronically high dosed. Pharmacologically speaking, effects should be moderately to strong, in terms of anxiolytic, anti-convulsant effects. Mild to no hypnotic and anti-epileptic effects, and also, mild to none amnesia effects.

- [MRK-409, aka MK-0343 in past literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147571), Another promising benzodiazepine. Partial agonist a2,a3, weak a1,a4,a5. Phase I halted due to unexpected sedating effects, it was not very sedating, just more than desired. Since it was designed as a sedation-free anxiolytic. Dosage in human studies was used between 0.1mg-3.0mg, optimum dose seems to around 1.0mg, 2.0mg starts to produce sedation. Tolerance should be none to very slow building.

- [L-838,417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-838,417), Structurally related to MRK-409 and TPA-023, it has almost the same pharmacological profile as MRK-409 but have no human studies. It is a a2,a3,a5 partial agonist, even weaker on a1, and almost none on a4,a6. Effects should be same as MRK-409, maybe slightly more sedating due to partial agonism at a5. Tolerance building should be very slow if any.

- [Bretazenil, or Ro16-6028 in past literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil), A promising, (Very low to low tolerance building)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8162672] benzodiazepine. Reached Phase III but halted due to sedation. Extremely promising, Extremely safe profile since it reached Phase III and was halted with sedation as only primary side effect - It was designed to be a sedation free anxiolytic. [Partial agonist a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7905829) [Doses as low as 0.25-0.5mg of bretazenil has shown to improve insomnia and reduce sleep disturbance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7746029)[Bretazenil Synergize with alcohol very well, better than diazepam, infact so well that one should actually not trying mixing them.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8799523) Effects of this drug should be Moderate in sedation, strong in anxiolytic, and moderate in anticonvulsive and epileptic effects. 
Ee
- [Abecarnil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecarnil), handful of [promising human studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1681563) - very slow tolerance building and only mild withdrawal was noted after chronic use (tolerance was only noted in high dosed groups). Extremely promising, large amounts of human data, [In humans, seems to cause little sedation, moderate to strong anxiolytic effects. Doses in studies ranged from 5mg to above 30mg.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8097921). Looks promising.

- FG-8205 (AKA, L-663,581): almost exact profile as bretazenil, however less researched. 

- [TPA023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPA-023), Dont try this one, Phase I and II showed cataract building up in several participant, extremely promising profile, but unfortunate side effects means this drug has no human potential.

- [TPA023B, Structurally very similar to MRK-409 and L-838,417. a2,a3 partial agonism](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881109354928). Extremely similar profile and dosing as well as effects.

- [TPA123](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/contributions-of-gabaa-receptor-subtype-selectivity-to-abuse-liability-and-dependence-potential-of-pharmacological-treatments-for-anxiety-and-sleep-disorders/A2EEBCA675D1950F806C8F9DBEE3AA18), Tolerance building but slower than traditional benzodiazepines due to [partial agonism of a1,a2,a3,a5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19789360). Animal studies but lacking human studies. Should be a moderate sedative and strong anxiolytic. 

- [TPA003, Somewhere between agonist and partial agonist on a3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0346-0226-6_1), no action on a1 and very weak a5. Should be a strong anxiolytic and very weak hypnotic. I actually wrote a paper debating GABAA a3 to be strongly involved in anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, as most studies concluded that a2 was the ""sole"" contribution to anxiolytic effects. My understanding is that in a2 studies, mice ""seemed"" to be have less anxiety because they're seem calm, but they're only calm because a2 is also the strongest subunit target for myorelexation. TPA003 is definitely one of the most interesting compounds I have personally came across.

- [EVT-201](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVT-201),  has successful Trials, more ongoing. Low tolerance building, moderate to strong hypnotic, moderate to weak anxiolytic. Partial agonist at alpha1. Seems to be like a slightly better and less adictive version of current Z-Drugs. [See more on my past post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/6hy5jv/evt201_partial_agonist_of_benzodiazepine/)

- [PWZ-029](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6gg0eh/pwz029_mixed_agonistinverse_agonist_binding/), unique one, partial agonist a3, weak a1,a2, inverse agonist a5. PWZ-029 Improved memory and reduce anxiety at the same time in animal models. Human dosage unknown.

- [Ocinaplon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocinaplon), Care on this one, people with sensitive and liver problems should not try this as the entire Phase III was halted by a single participant whos liver enzyme spiked after this drug. [strongest action at a3, with interesting metabolites that are also similar in profile](https://bmcpharma.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2210-8-11). Otherwise seems extremely promising with good profile. Strong anxiolytic activites and weak hypnotic. [Human studies dosed 90mg 3 times a day, total 270mg/day, with good results, no side effects reported](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2009.00109.x/full)


- [PF-06372865](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/2018/09000/A_randomised,_placebo_controlled_clinical_trial.11.aspx). Another a2/a3 PAM. This one is being developed by Pfizer Inc.

- [AZD7325, Another a2/a3 PAM](https://openinnovation.astrazeneca.com/azd7325.html). Binding affinity is high at GABAAα1, α2 and α3 (Ki of 0.5, 0.3 and 1.3nM, respectively), but not GABAAα5 (230nM). AZD7325 is being studied in humans, its been administered orally to healthy volunteers at single doses of up to 100mg and repeated doses up to 50mg QD for 7 days. Adverse events were CNS in nature, and included dizziness, feeling of relaxation, euphoric mood, somnolence, and headache.  *""Two Ph2a General Anxiety Disorder studies have been conducted. In the first, AZD7325 was dosed at either 2 or 5mg BID or 10mg QD for 28 days achieving compound plasma exposures of ~4 x Ki. In the second, it was dosed at either 5 or 15mg BID for 28 days and compared with lorazepam. While the primary objective of greater efficacy vs. placebo and/or lorazepam, as assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety scale, were not met at any of the doses tested, the placebo response rate was considered to be high and reduction in other anxiety endpoints at 10mg and depression MADRS score were noted.""* 

- [Emapunil (aka AC-5216, or XBD-173)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/490), Emapunil is a ligands of the translocator protein [18 kilodaltons (kD)]. It may promote the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, which exerts fast-acting anxiolytic agent, both in animals and humans, which lacks the unwanted side effects of benzodiazepines. [Repeated administration shows lack of tolerance and dependence.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584609001699?via%3Dihub)

- [SB-205,384](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB-205,384). SB-205,384 seems to binds preferentially to α3, α5, and α6 subunit containing subtypes, animal models showed that it produces anxiolytic effects with minimal sedation.

- [RWJ-51204](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWJ-51204). Unclear GABAA binding profile, but sedative effects only come after 20x the dose required for anxiolytic effects.

## Complete List (Herbals):

- [Baicalin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18723037). Baicalin is a herbal compound found in [Skullcap or Scutellaria-Baicalensis](https://examine.com/supplements/scutellaria-baicalensis/) and Scutellaria lateriflora. Baicalin showed significant preference for alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes compared to alpha1- and alpha5-containing subtypes in whole-cell patch clamp studies. Its effects should be mildly anxiolytic without sedating or memory-impairing effects.

- [Wogonin](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.07.011). Wogonin's GABAA profile is unclear, but mild sedative efffects were noted on top of anxiolytic and anti-convulsant effects.

- [K36](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.bcp.2003.08.016). K36 is interesting because it is the most potent plant-derived benzodiazepine agonist to date. It is reported to be an agonist at the a3 subunit, however, it also showed some effect at a1 although less potent. In animal models, results are promising as K36 showed anxiolytic effects without motor-impairment / sedative effects. Potentially hinting that its a1 efficacy is rather weak.

- [Valerenic Acid](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390808001950). Not completely profiled, but shows a2 preferance over a3 and a5, and low to none efficacy at a1. Anxiolytic effects were noted in animal studies with no indication for sedation induced by valerenic acid.

- [Apigenin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15451406). Mild partial agonsit at a1, no complete profile. Low potency. Seems to be similar to green tea catechins in terms of effect.

- [Catechins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17175819). Green tea catechins have extremely low bioavailability, and have shown to be a second-order PAM, which means it is a PAM of PAM, theoretically hinting that co-administration of green tea and xanax may enhance the effects of xanax.

- [Triethylene glycol, as found in Ashwaghanda](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172508). Unclear GABAA profile, is reported to be sedative, pass.

- [Withaferin-A from Ashwaghanda](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajb/article/view/96503). GABAA binding profile unclear. Shows anxiolytic efficacy without tolerance in rats following subchronic administration.

- Miltirone, https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0304-3940(91)90802-z, a partial agonsit of benzodiazepine receptors. No GABAA binding profile. Miltirone showed promising anxiolytic effects and was neither sedative nor addictive in mice even after chronic repeated administration. Miltirone also showed lower tolerance just as expected.

- [Kava's bioactive compounds](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157700), several kava compounds seem to have unique properties at the GABAA receptor.

"Creatine, 3.5g/daily for 15 days now, huge reduction in brain fog",239,9e5d8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9e5d8m/creatine_35gdaily_for_15_days_now_huge_reduction/,200,1536452168.0,"*__UPDATE 1/15/19: I had stopped taking creatine daily because I suspected it increased the number of night awakenings I was having, which compounded by my already questionable sleep quality, was worrisome. However I have resumed creatine in the form of 20 grams per day after very recently sustaining a very mild concussion. So far the creatine is helping with the headaches as well as the general fatigue in the week following the concussion. Studies have backed up its use in mild TBI so I will continue taking this dose until symptoms remit.__*

*__UPDATE 12/20/18: I have continued taking creatine for these past few months until very recently. I often eyeball the dosage with the scoop but it still remains between 2.5 and 5 grams of creatine. It’s effects on brain fog were still pronounced and definitely helped with returning to my baseline. I have STOPPED taking creatine the last few days to test it’s effects on my sleep. I recently resumed regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise to help me recover from my brain fog, and I was starting to suspect that the creatine combined with the effects of the exercise was giving me insomnia. However despite whatever results of this I still hold that creatine reduced my brain fog powerfully which benefitted me in my day to day life as well as at work.
I will note that it no longer gives me a sensation of anxiety or muscle tightness at any dose. And while it has reduced my brain fog, any effects on motivation are gone. It is definitely not a “pushy” feel.__*

*__UPDATE 09/24/18: About 30 days in. I am still dosing daily, and the effects have persisted. This is a dose of about 2.5 grams to sometimes 5 grams now. I have not seen any signs of brain fog creeping back. I am still subject to my quality of sleep, of course. Only CONS I notice are sometimes temporarily heightened anxiety after a dose, and at 5 grams I notice a tension in my neck and shoulders that lasts about an hour. I am still taking creatine monohydrate, though a bulk powder version of it. I am still making sure to hydrate appropriately. I also have continued to take it in the morning, before food. The only other thing I am taking is a lutein and zeaxanthin supplement I started 3 days ago.__*    


For a few years now I’ve had a persistent case of brain fog. It gets worse when I sleep fully, I.e 8 hours. If I’m feeling sleep deprived, the fog itself is somewhat abated but I have all the cognitive deficiencies that come with less sleep.    


My brain fog is a muddling of poor short term memory, slow reaction time, a very powerful unwillingness to engage in any kit of cognitively demanding task, and just the urge to do nothing and go back to sleep.    

Caffeine, nicotine, semax, phenylpiracetam, piracetam, theanine, prl-8-53, testosterone replacement therapy, exercise, magnesium, probiotics, sleeping with no light/sound, and a bunch of other things have not helped it at all.    

I started taking creatine on a whim after hearing it might help with maintaining proper cognition after sleep deprivation. Unexpectedly, I have felt a very significant reduction in my brain fog. I can feel it cutting through the fog, I am able to think more holistically instead of barely being able to focus on one small thing at a time. My memory has returned. And so has my motivation.    

This is a dose of 3.5 grams daily for the last 15 days. I have seen no build up of tolerance.    

I am submitting this to provide another data point as well as to see if anyone has had any similar experiences. I will update if I stop taking creatine or if the effects change.

Using Propranolol and gradually reducing the dosage to zero actually somewhat permanently reduced my anxiety,239,cfxz26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cfxz26/using_propranolol_and_gradually_reducing_the/,100,1563736701.0,"Basically, in my work, I'm required to interact with many people in important events. I would get anxiety during these (fast heart rate, face going red, voice breaking, etc).

The doctor prescribed me propranolol to help with the anxiety. I took it for my first big presentation and felt very good, the crowd responded well and I felt pretty good about myself. This first experience of doing this presentation slightly increased my overall confidence, knowing that I was able to actually give a good presentation.

Each successive presentation I **slightly** lowered the dosage of propranolol, and I was still able to give a good presentation! This just made me more confident about myself which I guess had a snowball effect. After about 6 months of many presentations and incrementally lowering the dose for each big event, I realised, that each successive presentation would slightly boost my confidence, which then offset the small decreases in my propranolol doses. Every good presentation I did improved my reputation and the way my colleagues saw me, which subsequently increased my overall self-esteem, and over time, my dosage got small enough and eventually reached zero. 

&#x200B;

So basically in my experience, controlled doses of propranolol can work to reduce long-term anxiety/increase confidence. The way I see it, controlled doses of propranolol is analogous to nudging a snowball down a hill- once you nudge it bit by bit, eventually the ball can continue rolling itself without needing any more nudges.

Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors (adenosine builds up when we are awake and makes us tired in the evening), which I'm sure many are aware of, but what I found interesting was the distinction between A1- and A2A-receptors and the fact that it is only A2A receptors that get desensitized (which explain quite a lot).

>*Caffeine can block different adenosine receptors in the brain, with varying effects. By blocking the A1 receptor, which promotes sleepiness when activated, caffeine can increase alertness.\[44\]\[45\] By blocking the A2A receptor, caffeine can increase dopamine levels, with stimulating and mood-enhancing effects.\[46\]*  
>  
>*The A1 receptor doesn’t seem to get desensitized, which may be why caffeine doesn’t lose its awakening effect. The A2A receptor does get desensitized, however, which is why coffee veterans don’t feel true stimulation even after drinking several cups — and why some people choose to cycle caffeine.*

L-Theanine and Ashwagandha have helped my severe depression any anxiety.,234,cmwwxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/cmwwxp/ltheanine_and_ashwagandha_have_helped_my_severe/,94,1565157997.0,"I know there have been many posts about this, but I wanted to share my experience here. If it violated any of the rules please let me know.

I've had depression and OCD since I was a young kid. In my childhood I went through trauma which caused all those conditions. And I didn't know until I was diagnosed recently.

*Disclaimer*: I've been working on myself heavily, but I'm pretty sure that the following supplements have helped me.

I didn't want to take medication so I started experimenting with different things that my doc suggested along with what I've seen here. I started out with St. John's Wort, which didn't do much. My understanding is that it's for mild depression and I've had severe clinical depression over the past 3-4 years. Also it did nada for anxiety, let alone OCD.

To supplement SJW, I started taking 200mg of 5-HTP daily, which I now want to start cutting back on. I've noticed that it's helped, but I can't quantify it. I did notice myself getting worse when I ran out for a few days though.

I've also been taking 200mg of L-Theanine and Ashwaganha twice a day. Both have helped substantially to lower my anxiety levels and reaction (rumination and compulsions) to intrusive thoughts. It still happens, but much less.

There are mornings that I woke up with a looming feeling of stress for no apparent reason. Usually this meant that the day ahead would be a tough one, but after I started taking L-Theanine and forcing myself to move and do things to distract myself the anxiety goes down significantly and I'm able to carry on with my day to day functions.

A common casualty of clinical depression and OCD is your sex drive and the ability to get and maintain an erection. Well, I can attest to that. For years I didn't even get my morning wood, despite me being healthy, according to my doctor. A week after I started taking Ashwagandha I noticed that I started getting morning wood again and on occasion it would be very strong and wouldn't lose it even while peeing. Most of the times I lose it moments after I wake up, but it's better than nothing.

I still have difficulty getting a normal erection, but I've noticed an improvement. Before I wouldn't be able to get hard even with fantasies and now that has started changing. I've also noticed myself getting very occasionally (once or twice a month) a random boner. By ""random"" I mean that I may see a girl dressed provocatively or flirt with a girl I like and I'll get a hard on. But even in these cases, the erections are probably a 20%.

Small steps.

However, I assure you that they have all been answered before. The search function works well, please use it before asking basic questions that we have all seen 100 times. I do not want to discourage discussions. However, we should limit those discussions to trying to expand information, not regurgitate what we already know.

* Modafinil is a wakefulness promoting agent.

* Modafinil will not replace dopaminiergic stimulants for ADHD.

* Modafinil will not work for everyone.

* Both enantiomers in racemic modafinil are active.

* R-modafinil is 3 times more active.

* Generics seem to be hit or miss. Some think they are the exact same, other don't...

* Your order will take a while to get here. Don't ask us if this is a normal thing.

* Modafinil increases hypothalamic histamine. This can lead to flush-like symptoms.

* There is a 99.999999% chance that you do not have Steven Johnson's Syndrome. If you did, Reddit is not the place to figure that out.

* No, the DEA will not throw you in jail for ordering modafinil. There is a chance that DHS will confiscate your order. If you are in Canada, then there is a higher risk of it being confiscated.

* It is not a miracle drug for improving cognition. There is no such thing. I'm sorry Limitless has misled you.

So if you find any new information on modafinil that is interesting, by all means post it here so we can discuss it. Please, no more long winded anecdotes about how modafinil worked for you.

I don't drink coffee so I reliably track my caffeine consumption to stay in the sub-300 mg per day range.

I don't really get negative effects from it (no jitters, no anxiety, no serious tolerance) but I do crash hard quite often.  This appears to the result of some kind of pharmacokinetic drawback.  

For some reason, re-dosing never fully fixes the problem.  Once the ""crash"" kicks in, it's basically permanent until the next day.  (Side comment - does anyone have any explanation for this?)

Over the past month I've been taking 100 mg of extended-release caffeine 2-3x per day, and it has been a completely different experience.  There is no crash at all, and while its presence is a tiny bit more subtle, I get a much more useful set of effects out of it.

Non-caffeine days are also a bit easier, as I suppose my brain no longer anticipates a rush of energy every morning.  If I don't take caffeine, I'm still pretty lethargic in comparison.  But it's definitely not as bad as it used to be.

Out of the hundreds of nootropics I've tried, XR caffeine is easily in first place by a mile.  

I highly recommend switching to non-caffeinated drinks and strictly using XR caffeine if you are looking for a solution to crashes, jitters, anxiety, etc.",2019-11-21 06:50:42

The results have been nothing short of extraordinary.

*“Man conquers the world by conquering himself.” - Zeno*

&#x200B;

At 13 years of age, I was involved in a car accident which resulted in a severe TBI. This, along with playing 6 years of American football (multiple minor concussions, etc.) all throughout high school/college has left me with severe anxiety (social and general), insomnia and reoccurring depression in young adulthood. 

I do see a doctor regularly, however, the medications I am prescribed provide a band-aid cure at best, but no long term solutions. 

Regular exercise and my adoption of a ketogenic/IF diet have done wonders for my anxiety, but I would still struggle at times, especially with insomnia.

After an extremely rough patch a couple of months ago, I did some research and decided to start the following protocol (beginning July 30th) twice-weekly, approximately 6 hours before bedtime:

* 10-20mg Yohimbine HCL
* 15-30 minutes Ice Bath
* Wim-Hof style breathing (40 breaths in/out, last exhale hold 15s+, inhale hold 15s+)

If you can handle the initial feelings/emotions of extreme discomfort/terror/impending doom/freezing to death/trepidation, the benefits are innumerable.

This is hormesis at its finest.

This protocol has improved my mindstate moreso than any herb, nootropic, practice or supplement I have ever used. At work, I am a productive machine. My social life is the best it has ever been and I consistently find myself pushing outside of my comfort zone to engage with new people. My sleep is now deep, regular and uninterrupted. Things that used to give me debilitating anxiety now seem like a joke (namely social situations/work deadlines). My time in the gym is now enjoyable; workouts I used to find challenging (psychologically and physically) are now commonplace. 

This semi-weekly torture sesh seems to force me into a state of mindfulness that extends to all areas of my life. 

The overall attitude/outlook on life that this practice seems to provide me is ""nothing that might occur in my everyday life could possibly be any worse than what I just experienced.""

Looking for some intelligent discussion on the matter. Will be happy to provide more sources if need be! I realize this is extreme (masochistic even) and should only be considered after other potential options have been thoroughly explored.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Over the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to try many nootropics/supplements to help rid myself of anxiety/depression and improve my everyday functioning. Some of them I found to be extremely helpful, others seemed to have no effect, or were very effective but unsustainable. A semi-weekly session of 15-30 minute ice baths along with an anxiogenic dose of Yohimbine HCL and some Wim Hof breathing is a solution that suits me quite well. YMMV.

LSD in my Coffee - My 2 Month Miccrodosing Review,234,7dlp2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7dlp2t/lsd_in_my_coffee_my_2_month_miccrodosing_review/,89,1510961417.0,"Hey friends! Like so many of you here, I was intrigued by the many possible benefits of microdosing LSD. Having taken normal (100-200 mcg) doses in the past and fortuitously having access to some quality LSD, I decided to give it a shot. I kept a journal throughout these two months, with entries for the majority of the days I dosed.

**edit** - No, I was not putting tabs of LSD in my coffee, I was using them sublingually 

*Background* - 28 year old male, pretty extensive experience with nootropics of all sorts, neurotrophics, adaptogens, etc. I'd used mushrooms and LSD on and off for a period of two or three years, from about 19-22, and have only used full doses once or twice since then. Plenty of years of meditation under my belt, as well as regular exercise, yoga, very healthy diet with plenty of greens, yada yada. I say all this just to explain that I have experience with mind-altering substances, am well aware of the placebo effect and that I am fairly fine-tuned with understanding how a multitude of factors may be affecting my subjective experience of the world. 

**Dosing protocol** - My plan was to pretty much stick to the dosing protocol outlined by **James Fadiman**, namely of taking 8-12 mcgs once every 3 days. Sometimes it was one dose every 4 or 5 days, and once I dosed twice within three days, but I otherwise stuck to his protocol. That said, I did *not* dose volumetrically, and would like to do so in the future - because of this, each dose I took was not exact, and I know a few of the doses were closer to 20 or 25 micrograms, just because of how I was cutting the tabs. This was fine by me, as I wanted to see what kind of results these higher doses would bring.

I'll start with the cons.


**Cons**

*Decrease in raw computing power and focus* - Contrary to what many others find, I found that my raw mental power and focus actually *dropped slightly*, by around maybe 5-10 percent, more if the dose was higher. I'd say that my baseline in these two areas is pretty good, nothing phenomenal, but I have no problem sitting down to read or write for anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours before needing a break, and am able to handle a very busy shift at work bartending with little to no errors. My thoughts are almost never erratic, and definitely don't suffer from any ADHD. 

The slight drop in focus and computing power was certainly not off-putting in any way, and in fact I found it mostly beneficial. It felt like I could make associations more quickly, and was more able to think *laterally* rather *linearly*. I would say microdosing increased my creativity and associative thinking. I was able to concentrate if needed, but if I needed absolute attention and raw computing power, I'd rather not have microdosed that day. I work as a bartender and the weekends certainly get intense. I'd always make sure that I wouldn't microdose on days that I knew I'd have a hectic shift.

*Decrease in working memory* - As alluded to above, if I needed to remember 4 different cocktails for one table, ring up a to go order, fire an entree for seat 12 because their appetizer just landed and then try to describe the subtle differences between our flagship IPA and our new lupulin powder based IPA, a microdose would likely throw me off a bit. I found that microdosing decreased my performance and memory in intense situations by maybe 5-10% - I just wouldn't be firing on all pistons. 

*No desire to lift* - Self-explanatory. I'd have to force myself to go lift in the gym, whereas normally I have to force myself to take days off every now and then. Trail running, on the other hand... 

*Higher doses* - Higher doses increased the effects of all the cons listed above. At higher doses (ballpark 20 mcgs), I fumbled my words sometimes, had difficulty remembering something specific, and really didn't have any interest in doing anything productive. That said, things were still quite enjoyable, and I delighted in going for a run in the mountains, a walk in the park, playing with my dog, socializing, listening to music... But I didn't want to be productive or work.


**Neutral**

*Decrease in sex drive* - No surprise here for me, LSD has always made me disinterested in sex. No ED or anything, just could take it or leave it.

*Gas in my teeth* - Not sure why, but the body load of acid or mushrooms has always made me feel like there was some sort of chemical gas in my teeth especially, and sometimes bones and muscles. It's weird, not necessarily bad, and with microdosing was present to a much lesser degree, maybe 50% of the time.

*Little in terms of 2nd day afterglow* - Many people have reported that you microdose one day, have an afterglow or even enhanced effects on the 2nd day, and return to baseline to reset homeostasis on the third. Maybe half of the time I noticed an afterglow on the second day, namely a slightly better mood above baseline, but not really anything ""cognitive enhancement"" wise. May have just been placebo effect since I heard Dr. Fadiman explain it. Not sure, and thats ok.


**Pros**

*Enhanced creativity* - While dosing may have slightly hampered raw computing mental power, it *definitely* increased creativity and associative thinking. Many an insight was made while microdosing, and I was able to see connections between seemingly unrelated things. In this sense, microdosing would fit the bill of a cognitive enhancer, and I could see it having its place in my tool cabinet for all the reading, writing and research I do.

*More synchronicity* - Many of you who have used psychedelics at full doses have probably had more than a few instances of intense synchronicities, coincidences, deja vu, and intuitiveness. Psychedelics are often considered spiritual in nature so this should be of no surprise. While dosing, there were plenty of times when I would think of something I hadn't thought of in a while, be it a topic, object or person, only to have them pop up that same day or the following. Whether you call that intuitiveness or something else, it was noticeable maybe 70% of the times I dosed.

*Enhanced enjoyment* - Man, I just *really* enjoyed my days microdosing. It was all the little things one would expect - music didn't sound different, but it was more enjoyable; driving all these local backroads in the fall, while looking the same as if I wasn't microdosing, was much more enjoyable; I appreciated all the little things more. I wasn't high or felt any kind of pleasant buzz, but I appreciated things a lot more.

*Positive selfishness* - There's probably a term for this, but on days I dosed, I was much more likely to just do what I *wanted* to do, whether or not it was what I *should* be doing. I also found it very easy to say no to things I didn't want to do or to things that others might try to force on me, and all of this in a guilt-free way. And I don't mean I just said yes to eating pizza and drinking beer - more than once while microdosing I drove around the local backroads finishing podcasts I found interesting, or I knew I should be going to the gym, but decided to take my dog for a walk in the park because that was the more enjoyable and meaningful thing to do. If some friends asked me to meet up for a few drinks, I was perfectly happy to say no and continue reading or go through with hiking like I had planned.

*Enjoyment of social interactions* - I'm a pretty social person anyway, and really enjoy interacting with people, be they friends, customers at work or random people on the street or at a bar. This enjoyment was *greatly* enhanced on days I dosed. I found myself interacting more often with random people I didn't know, with no hesitation. I was more likely to make jokes and play around with customers rather than just trying to offer good service. **This was maybe my favorite aspect of dosing**, as well as the following effect.

*More playful* - I'm already a pretty playful person, cracking jokes, playing little pranks, role playing with friends and coworkers. On days I dosed, this was enhanced greatly, and this was the aspect I enjoyed the most. I love people, and the combination of enjoying social interactions and being even more playful *alone* would be enough reason to keep microdosing a regular thing in my life.




**TL;DR** In short, microdosing, for me, *scatters* my mental energies ever so slightly. It slightly decreases my ability to focus in on something, but is great for enhancing sociability, creativity, enjoyment of the majority of activities, especially interacting with others, and is definitely something I would like to continue to experiment with in the future. I'd love to try it with psilocybin mushrooms or psilocybin itself, but alas, these are currently unavailable to me. ",2017-11-18 05:00:17

Reviewing EVERY nootropic I've bought (33 substances),227,frczn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/frczn4/reviewing_every_nootropic_ive_bought_33_substances/,306,1585543617.0,"Edit: post calling me out is complete misinformation. I described EVERYTHING I felt with these nootropics. I used them all as advised, but doubled dose at the end if I felt nothing. Sorry if this review isn't everything you expected it to be.

&#x200B;

This is a lot, but I'm bored, so here we go. They will be ranked from least-most beneficial. This is all subjective. What was I attempting to cure? Anxiety, depression, withdrawals, and lack of motivation.

**Nootropics that were a complete waste of money (don't get offended):**

*Inositol* \- I took 1 gram, all the way up to 17 grams. Nothing. No reduction in anxiety or depression. Also incredibly expensive and bulky.

*Jujube* \- I'm not sure if this is really a nootropic, but since it is a supposed anxiolytic, maybe? I started a low dose and then worked my way up to a high dose of about 30 grams or something of dry powder. All that happened was I got a little tired, no cognitive benefits.

*Mucuna Pruriens* \- This one is a little debatable, but I fail to see what the hype is about. I took the recommended doses, and once doubled it, but saw very little results, if any.

*5-HTP* \- I guess this one will make a lot of people mad, but from my standpoint, this was useless. I didn't really feel any different after using it, maybe just a little more tired? Perhaps serotonin isn't my problem.

*GABA* \- This is an interesting one, because at first use I felt some-what relaxed for about an hour. Usage after that lacked any benefit, though I kept taking it for the growth hormone benefit. But the depressed breathing side effect was VERY anxiogenic, and all in all is not worth it at all.

*Ashwagandha* \- KSM-66 and regular ashwagandha for about a month inflamed my thyroid. Felt like I was being choked. The side effect stopped after I discontinued use. I read up afterwards and learned ashwagandha tampered with thyroid hormones. Also, did not feel any benefits at all while using this one.

*Sulbutiamine* \- I bought this stuff seeking a little stimulation, perhaps a mood lift. Nothing. All that happened was disappointment, so I decided to take 5 of them, totalling 1 gram on an empty stomach. It resulted in me puking violently, with traces of blood in my puke. Threw away the bottle after that.

*St John's Wort* \- Figured I would give this one a try. Didn't see any results with regular doses, so I took double the amount, and still nothing. Decided not to re-purchase when it ran out.

*L-Theanine* \- Here's another one that might piss people off. I saw no result at all from using this stuff. I suppose it's a little nice to take it with coffee, might take some of the edge off, but aside from that I'm not sure if there's any functionality, or if it is worth the cost. Would not recommend unless drinking matcha tea.

*Schisandra Chinensis* \- This is an adaptogen, so it's possible that I didn't take it long enough, but I spent 10 dollars on it, for a high-content extract, and after two weeks I was already running out. Didn't notice any improvement to mood or motivation, even with a high dose.

*Maca* \- At the time of me getting this, I was a daily kratom user, so my libido was really messed up. After taking it consistently for months, I can't say I really saw an improvement on anything, energy or anything.

*Kanna* \- I've tried this sublingual, and smoked. No clear benefits. J'm not sure if it did anything, really.

**Nootropics that were** ***kind of*** **worth it, but not enough to justify price:**

*Lithium Orotate* \- This stuff is iffy for me. I've taken it alone and alongside agmatine sulfate (foreshadowing here). I think it *may have* potentiated agmatine sulfate, but now I'm not so sure. I've stopped using it and seen no real difference.

*Polygala Tenuifolia* \- I'm still playing around with this stuff I guess. The first time I took a high dose and fell asleep on the couch. After that I lowered it with some variety. Not feeling much improvement, and I'm not sure if it really does anything for me. I thought it was supposed to be stimulating. Maybe it synergizes with agmatine? Not sure.

*Cordyceps* \- The first time I took this stuff, I was wired out of my mind. Now I don't feel any change at all. I'm skeptical if it is doing anything. May work for some, but not sure if it works for me.

*Noopept* \- This stuff isn't bad, but on it's own, I don't see what the point is. When I combined it with American Skullcap (smoked) or phenylpiracetam, I felt like I had razor sharp focus. But aside from that, there's not much in the way of motivation or anxiolyticism for me.

*Rhodiola Rosea* \- I've only been taking this for a few days, so take this with a grain of salt. But I'm not seeing the point of this stuff. I've taken twice the recommended dosage, and nothing. No results. I guess time will tell, but so far, I'm not seeing the point.

*Hydrafinil* \- I suppose it kind-of works. I suppose it is some-what stimulating. Subtly. But is it stimulating enough to justify price? No. It also makes me hostile when I'm on it. I don't like putting this foreign substance into my body either, so considering how it's not NEARLY as effective as caffeine, I don't think it's worth it.

*L-Glycine* \- I've heard this talked about as a nootropic. I'm not sure how it qualifies as one, maybe because of the serotonergic functionality, maybe for sleep, it's unclear. I started taking it for sleep, obsessive thinking and for growth hormones. It didn't do much for sleep or for obsessive thinking, so I don't think it's really worth it. (review from taking 20 grams)

**Nootropics that were** ***alright:***

*Magnolia Bark Extract* \- Definitely some benzo-esque vibes here. Kind of euphoric. Potentiated a ton when taken with American Skullcap. But I can't say it helped me a whole lot mentally, or enough to justify the price and possible addiction.

*Kava* \- This stuff worked. Yes, it is a relaxing nootropic. But it did nothing for my social anxiety, and it depressed me while I was on it. There's hepatoxicity associated with it, it's super expensive, and all in all, I don't think it's worth it. I'd much rather have a beer, as bad as that sounds.

*Creatine* \- Just putting this here because for whatever reason it is considered a nootropic. No bad experiences with it. Worth the money for bodybuilding. I guess it's considered a stimulant some-how, but I wouldn't take it for cognitive effects.

*Uridine Monophosphate, Fish Oil, Alpha GPC* \- Putting these down here because I do believe they may have contributed to alleiviating some of my depression symptoms. They didn't help with motivation, they contributed to a manic episode at one point, and there are physical benefits associated with fish oil and alpha gpc (growth hormones on this one). They might have helped repair my dopamine receptors a bit, though it's too early to tell. This combo can be slightly euphoric in high doses.

*Multivitamin* \- I'm just putting this here because it's some-how considered a nootropic. It didn't change me at all, but it's good to have because the western diet has poor nutrition, which could be bad for cognitive abilities.

**Nootropics that benefitted me, but had short-comings:**

*Yohimbe* \- Excellent pre-workout. Insane stimulant. Doesn't do much for mental benefits, but supposedly can lead to fear extinction through continued use because of its adrenaline spiking. Helps me move faster at work and in the gym. Worth every cent. Only bad experience is over-stimulation sometimes and slight mental shocks.

*Phenylpiracetam* \- Best thing I've found for motivation, social anxiety, and focus. BUT it doesn't even work if you take it the next day. Or the next day. Or a few days later. I used to think three days was the key but even that wasn't true. It's like a once-a-week, once-every-two-weeks stimulant. No addiction, withdrawal, side effects. The tolerance issue really sucks, and dosing higher doesn't seem to fix it.

*American Skullcap* \- When I first tried this stuff, I left a raving review and it blew up. I'm coming back here to say, yes there are a lot of benefits to using it, but not general overall benefits. It works good for helping you quit other drugs, as you can smoke it and put your feeling of wanting to get high into the skullcap, because it's non-addictive and helps with withdrawal symptoms. It also seems to help with focus, especially in combination with phenylpiracetam or noopept. It's relaxing, but I wouldn't say good for sleep. Once I was having a minor anxiety attack, and it helped me chill out a bit. Doesn't do anything for social anxiety, it's not euphoric, and I really don't need to use it that much at all. May be good for some people, though.

**Nootropics that changed my life (so far):**

***Agmatine Sulfate*** \- After I started using this stuff, my depressive lows were healed. I stopped dwelling on negative thoughts, I felt better about myself, and this led to an upward spiral in my life, where a lot of my hardcore depression symptoms were alleiviated completely. I felt some-what cognitively-enhanced, like I was thinking clearer, and the experience has been great, two months later. It did not help with fatigue or lack of motivation, but overall, I highly recommend this one.

***NAC*** \- When I first began taking this stuff, I was using it as a liver support because I was taking some questionable things, and I didn't want liver damage. But what was crazy, is I just so happened to pull it together and quit kratom. I also was picking my face less. At the time, I didn't expect any of these benefits from it. This leads me to believe that NAC is excellent at fighting addiction. That being said, I still felt the needy impulse to text girls, and I still picked at my face, so I guess it's not perfect. Overall, though, I highly recommend this, especially to addicts. It may just change your mind-set.

***Caffeine (Coffee)*** \- I've been taking caffeine and coffee my whole life, as I'm sure many of you have. There's downsides to it, as I'm sure many of you know, but the benefits outweigh the negatives. It helps my social anxiety, though worsening my physical anxiety symptoms, and helps with motivation. It also puts me in a better mood, especially coffee with its MAOIs. I don't mind being addicted to this substance, though I don't like that it can make me more impulsive through adrenaline and dopamine. Out of everything I've tried, caffeine remains one of the best nootropics available. And I plan to see how I can further build my stack around this substance, because as far as I know, there's not much that can come close to beating it.",2020-03-30 10:16:57

Also I had a bad MRI (there were myelin lesions in the left frontal lobe). Doctors couldn't explain the reason. Medicine is terrible in Russia. Have sent to the psychiatrist who has begun paxil - from it or him only became worse in a month. Because the problem was more serious.

For testing, I prepared two boxes, in which I put nootropics. Most of the nootropics I tested before getting to know this subreddit - I got from doctors on prescription (I visited many different doctors) 

1) Nootropics that helped

2) Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)


Before sending the substance to the box number 2, I tested it several times

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 box (Nootropics that helped):

Bromantane (my top https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6imfwc/bromantane_is_the_best_drug/)

Phenibut (instant socialization, anxiety reduce, better motivation, energy, vision and focus, powerfull antidepressive effect. I would take it forever, but it has a very fast tolerance. You can take 2 times a week. Otherwise there will be a strong withdrawal and drowsiness)

Uridine (very nice https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6fkq42/finally_i_got_to_uridine/)

Piracetam (basic nootropic for memory, mood, energy, vision. The effect isn't very strong, but you can take it forever. Other substances strengthen piracetam)

Alcar (energy, better vision, strengthens piracetam)

ALA (for alcar)

Meldonium (for energy)

sunflower lecithine (safe choline source, for piracetam)

Omega3 (small effect against depression)

Vitamine d (small effect against drowsiness)

Vitamine b6/b12 

Potassium (for alcar)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 box (Nootropics that do not fit (no effect or too strong side effects)):

Methylcolabomin/Methylfolate (super drowsiness and weakness. It sounds like nocebo, but I tried it several times. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nh2p9/b12folate_deficiency_symptoms/dka8icb/)

Semax (brainfog and problem with concentration. At first he even helped me, but after the addition of piracetam, horror began. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/661x9q/semax_piracetam_brainfog/)

Microdosing (hard to think https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/69l6la/first_day_mictodosing/)

Noopept (robot with bad short-term memory https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6o2hvi/noopept_amazing_productivity/dke2e87/)

Caffeine/L-theanine (drowsiness. After a few days, it causes drowsiness. Probably because of l-theine. I read similar stories)

Nicotine (https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6nzu6m/i_cant_use_nicotine_why/)

Intranasal insulin (brainfog, drowsiness, dizzy. I tried from 10iu to 40iu)

L-tyrosine, Nalt (good result in first day, drowsiness in others. Like all the nootropics from this list - I've tried it several times. Each time such an effect)

Ginkgo (stomach pain)

Coluracetam (super depression with suicidal thoughts. A terrible thing. I don't know why, but tried several times sublingually)

Oxyracetam, alpha-gpc (depression. Alpha-gpc in many causes cholina depression, I'm no exception. Oxiratsetam acts on me like a coluracetam, but weaker.)

Emoxypine (mexifican/mexidol) (drowsiness, for 3 weeks except drowsiness nothing happened)

Aniracetam (choking. I took a few steps and started a shortage of air. After that, I checked my heart. It's all right. None of nootropics anymore caused this problem. Even the perception of the world has changed. It's hard to describe)

Huperzine (strong dizziness. It was scary)

Rhodiola (dizziness, very strange condition. The effect is unpleasant)

Picamilon (a little stimulation and relaxation for a couple of hours. Fast tolerance)

Actovegin (tried in tablets. Very expensive drug and weak effect. The positive effect is definitely there, but it is not worth the money)

Phenylpiracetam (it always causes me a very strong migraine. Choline doesn't help. No other substance causes such headaches.)

This bill will literally create a  blanket ban access for the government and AG jeff sessions to ban all  compounds instantly, instead of the DEA having to individually take a  specific substance and prove with an 8 factor analysis that it is a  threat to the american people. Very similar to what happened in the UK a  few years back with the psychoactive substance act. The SITSA bill  would not only ban all research chems but Nootropics as well such as  kratom phenibut modafinil and tianeptine among many others. According to  an email I received a few days ago by the American Kratom Association,  the FDA lobbied a powerful figure within this meeting to ensure it  passes onto the House Floor. If it goes through there then it is all in  Jeff Sessions hands at that point. 

I just learned about this yesterday  from the kratom subreddit where an individual stated this information  from the House Rules Committee meeting where they addressed the SITSA   bill,  ""For those who were watching the House Rules Committee Hearing  this   afternoon, it was expected that Representative Pocan would  present his   kratom amendment before the Committee.  Unfortunately, the  combination   of the delay in the start of the Rules Committee Hearing,  and another   legislative issue that required the presence of  Representative Pocan in   another Hearing and a House Floor issue that  prevented him from getting   back to the Rules Committee before the  SITSA portion of the  Hearing  was closed.  Representative Pocan did  file the kratom amendment  in a  timely way, and the Rules Committee  should vote on the amendment  before  SITSA is referred to the Floor.   If the Rules Committee defeats  the  kratom amendment, we will then look  to amend SITSA on the House  Floor.   The House is expected to vote on  SITSA on Friday""  

Do we as adults have the right to make decisions about what we put in  our own bodies and what we experience with our own consciousness without  reference to the powers of the state, or must we seek permission from  the state in order to explore our own consciousness? This isnt a war on drugs, but a war on consciousness and holding the ability as a sovereign being to ingest whatever substance we please, as long as it does not harm others",2018-06-15 16:02:19
Top 5 Nootropics that have helped me the most.,225,8fajc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8fajc2/top_5_nootropics_that_have_helped_me_the_most/,148,1524852714.0,"There are top 5 nootropics that have helped me the most.

**BRIEF HISTORY**

* 22 year old college student. High-stress environment, but I never *feel* stress acutely like most people, though I do feel it chronically as ""burnout"" (threshold: 10h+ days for 4 weeks+ with no breaks in-between).
* ONE Thing that makes it or breaks it: **Sleep from 8-10pm, Wake at 4:30am**
* What ALWAYS helps: Meditate, Exercise, and Diet regularly (one cheat day a week). *[next step: add cardiovascular work with C25K]*
* Extremely sensitive to changes in these routines (especially sleep schedule). Without them, would occasionally have moodswings with depressed mood (but nothing clinically diagnosed). It gets VERY BAD, but as long as most of the aforementioned things are in place they NEVER happen. I'm confident that as long as my sleep is REGULAR, the whole world could be in flames and somehow I still wouldn't be able to feel depressed.
* Default personality: Type A and always building up momentum, getting things done and moving things forward. These things make me feel alive. Conversely, when things are moving purposelessly slow, I become bored (immediate), restless/anxious (short-term) and depressed (long-term).
* Highly-sensitive to external stimulus. Noise isolation headphones and earplugs work really well for me because they essentially conserve all the energy that would've otherwise been dissipated to these trivial stimuli.
* No history of insomnia. No history of psychiatric or medical conditions (previously had pre-hypertension).

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Fish Oil | Classic staple for cardiovascular health. 
CoQ10 | Classic staple for cardiovascular and hypertension
Bacopa | Improved memory in the first year. Can tell loss of effect if I'm off for 1month+
L-Tyrosine | Gamechanger for me. Able to focus on only ONE thing at a time. This plus earplugs gets me in the zone without fail (most effective fasted)
Ashwagandha | Always works to relieve stress. My mind feels lighter. **Too much and I feel like I'm just drifting through life though**. But if coupled with L-Tyrosine can be very effective. (Not effective with Rhodiola, Caffeine/L-Theanine, must be used in isolation and does not improve my sleep).

Other nootropics that I take as needed:

Nootropic | Effect on me
---|---
Rhodiola | No significant effect. Taking it regularly now to finish the bottle. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)
Phenibut | Think of it as a stronger Ashwaganda, or as a supplement with only the positive effects of Alcohol.
Caffeine/L-Theanine | AVOIDING IT. With all the nootropics available to get me into a calm focused state and generate high-quality work, it makes no sense to me to go back to caffeine. One cup would get me energized, but that energy is dissipated and not channeled. Two cups would again get me in the zone when I am ready to kill a fucking lion. Three cups and I won't be able to sleep. It's great for anything physical (pre-workout for a gym PR), but terrible for any intellectual where higher cognitive functions are required (learning). **Coffee is like a shotgun whereas L-Tyrosine is like a sniper rifle.** Replaced with green tea instead.
Magnesium | No noticeable effect. Seems to keep moodswings at bay. Still taking it because there's no harm. (Thinking of removing it, what do you guys think?)

What are the top 5 nootropics you swear by? What nootropics should I remove from my stack?

"Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input with an experiment I am running, it's like a coffee brew that mimics the effects of an LSD microdose (in me at least, and I'm curious about others)",225,2xonnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2xonnt/hey_rnootropics_i_need_your_helpinput_with_an/,158,1425344705.0,"I posted this in /r/Psychonaut and someone suggested I post it here.

Hey /r/nootropics, I need your help/input.

I'm autistic and I've used psys (mainly LSD) to fix my life. I went from on-the-brink-of-homeless to working/studying in the field of neuroscience and therapy.. I still regularly experiment on myself with various drugs and I still need psys to keep my life in order.

The biggest problem I have is that psys give me insights, but the associated emotions and feelings don't last. So, when I'm off them, I STILL have to fight against my consciousness all day to function normally, but my insights into my own psyche and the human psyche make it easier.

Microdoses are pretty much a cure for autism for me. If I'm on a microdose of LSD or mescaline, I have perfect days, utterly perfect. Psychedelic tolerance is a big issue and my ""golden egg"" in life is trying to circumvent it.

I have found a bit of a roundabout way to do it, and I'd like your input, and if anyone is willing to try it I'd be very grateful for some feedback.

Basically, I've mixed a couple of seeds/plants into a type of coffee that mimics the feeling of a microdose, for me anyway. The ingredients are:

* 1/4 teaspoon of powderized guarana (I just chuck the nuts in a blender, but there's more efficient ways to do it)
* 1/8 teaspoon of powderized nutmeg (this has to be fresh from the nuts, processed nutmeg won't do the trick)
* 1 teaspoon of raw cacao
* 1 teaspoon of any coffee powder, I use mocca

The active chemicals in this mix are 

* **caffeine** (*guarana* and *coffee*)
* **theobromine** (*guarana* and *raw cacao*)
* **MAOI** (tetrahydro-β-carboline, *raw cacao*)
* **elimicin** (precursor to mescaline, *nutmeg*)
* **myristicin** (precursor to MMDA, *nutmeg*)

All of these combine to give an experience that lasts roughly 6-8 hours. This experience feels almost identical to an LSD microdose (around 10-15mcgs). Elevated energy, colour enhancement, creativity enhancement, massive amounts of energy, positive and magical feeling to the day. I have used it consistently for a while now and it has been EXTREMELY effective. I doubt it's a placebo but I can't be sure, which is why I'm posting here. I can't discuss any of this stuff with my colleagues or in my faculty for obvious reasons.

If anyone has some input or is willing to try out this brew for themselves that would be awesome.

(Please note that raw cacao is not the same as cocoa. Cocoa is heated and processed cacao, and in a lot of cases it has sugars added to it as well. Raw cacao is just the bean, which actually tastes quite bitter and is a bit chunky)

(**UPDATE** Four experience reports so far. One person with autism who had a nearly identical experience, one person who had a productive day, colour enhancement and increased focus, but needed to redose on coffee, and one person with anxiety, colour enhancement, and one person with no effects.

**FURTHER UPDATE** It would seem that this brew is DEFINITELY active, except it varies from person to person, but it's not always the intended results. In the majority of cases, similar effects are experienced, but not all of them. Only in the case of one other user, who has autism like me, were the effects identical. I can rule out a placebo in that case since I didn't tell him what it would do, and his description was pretty much identical to mine. In about 10-15% of the users, no effects were experienced. Take from this what you will!)",2015-03-03 06:35:05

IT WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.  This is extremely important to know when experimenting with nootropics because some can put you in a bad mood, dangerous state, or even suicidal.  If you are already depressed, you need to be EXTREMELY mindful of this.

If you take something and it makes you anxious, just stay calm, do some deep breathing and/or other calming activities, maybe have some calming foods, and wait it out.  You can always go to the bathroom if you are in a social, academic, or work setting.

Always remember the phrase, ""this too shall pass,"" just like anything in life.  Don't attach to any one thought or mood and think you will be that way forever.  Just let the nootropic wear off and realize you will be back to normal soon.  **Bottom line:** be AWARE of yourself and DETACHED when you try nootropics.

Instead of saying straight up ""I don't know, it's complicated"" he mumbles something about dopamine or serotonin. You are supposed to play the dopamine or serotonin card to sound insightful when talking about the brain.

Are we trying to explain too many things with neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine? Even some high-quality articles fall into that category.

I made an app for keeping track of the nootropics I've tried and when I take them. Now it's free to the public!,218,eefuan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/eefuan/i_made_an_app_for_keeping_track_of_the_nootropics/,67,1577105837.0,"**What's good y'all, happy holidays.**

You might have seen a similar post from me before. About a year ago I was looking for an app that would track all of my substance and nootropic use in a good looking interface with a focus on privacy, but everything was either stored online or not geared towards what I wanted; or more of a journal that could be used for tracking anything.

I knew a little bit of coding (I dropped out of my second Computer Science class) but I figured I would start a side project in my free time. I started working on an app that my friends and I used to track our substance use. I put out the first version on Easter and since then I've brought in around 15,000 downloads which honestly *blows my fucking mind.*

I'm coming back with an update because I recently released a completely new version of the app now that I've learned a lot more about app development. Basically, I gutted the whole thing and started over. It may be a lateral move with minimal increase in features but it's a lot more secure and is actually coded properly.

**Everything is stored locally on your device** (focusing on privacy) and it's easy to use and nice to look at. Data can be viewed in many ways including custom metrics *(When was the last time I took this nootropic? What is my average dosage for this nootropic?)*, and can be **exported/backed up** to a spreadsheet or **deleted** at any time.

It's been *so fucking awesome* to watch this little project I started actually become part of someone's daily routine.

I put 200 hours into this update over the last 6 weeks and it's finally at a point where I thought I would share it once again. I'm currently working on things like:

- Reminders to take medications or to check in x amount of time after taking something
- Graphs and charts to visualize data and compare to the past
- Securing with Touch ID or Face ID
- More metrics/queries and abilities to track specific statistics
- *For you legacy users: I'm bringing back the ability to see entries in a plain list, since I know the whole cell block thing was a major shift and some people prefer it the other way*

The app is **totally free** to download. I have a tier for a dollar a month after 100 entries but it's really only meant to either serve as a donation or for power users. Even if you use Tablets once a day for 3 months you won't hit the limit, I haven't had a single person reach the max since I implemented the rule lol.

Liftmode is currently selling these masks for $14.88 each, whereas the market price before price gouging began was less than $1 per *unopened* N95 mask, according to a [Wired Story about price gouging on masks.](https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-amazon-curb-face-mask-price-gouging/)

**Warning** - these masks are unreliable because they have been opened. Do not purchase them. The manufacturer, 3M, says the [expiration date is only valid for masks in original packaging](https://safetytownsquare.3mcanada.ca/articles/why-do-disposable-respirators-have-a-defined-shelf-life). The Wired story also warns about shady vendors like Liftmode opening and repacking masks. Liftmode does not clarify what the expiration date is. In addition, the surgeon general recently warned people to stop buying masks, as our panic buying prevents medical professionals from obtaining the masks they need. [(Source: CNN)](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/485332-surgeon-general-stop-buying-masks). Liftmode is directly contributing to the erosion of public health through diverting packages of masks away from the medical professionals who need them most.

Here are [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/ySnHEWz) of the liftmode email and website that show the fear tactics they use to advertise their price-gouged and ineffective wares.

I have given Liftmode a lot of money and always thought of them as a reputable company. But I will never shop there again because of this incredibly unethical profiteering scheme. I have also reported them to Amazon, who is cracking down on price gouging vendors. I encourage you to similarly stop patronizing and start reporting Liftmode for their utterly unethical practices.

(**EDIT 3:** u/liftmode has give some responses. I hope you read them, but I'm not satisfied by the flimsy and contradictory excuses. Favorite excuse, for example, is that these masks are non-medical, so they couldn't help doctors stay safe anyway. BUT they can still help Liftmode customers stay safe. I also was not surprised to see their musings on capitalism and socialism and 1488, plus their predictions of the future. Nor to see their ""people like me"" comment. Stay away my friends.)

Imidazenil: The Versatile Benzodiazepine,225,dnh14h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dnh14h/imidazenil_the_versatile_benzodiazepine/,129,1572140137.0,"Greetings Travelers,

One day, I promise to compile a comprehensive overview of my near-decade of experiences with a matrix of psychoactive compounds. Today, however, I would like to prevent an experience report for a most peculiar compound. This post is well over a year in the making and, unless I am mistaken, I am the only human being who has experience Imidazenil.

So how did we get here?

There are many researchers on the nootropics subreddit well known for their extensive knowledge regarding GABA based anxiolytics. Their posts, which are easy to search for, piqued my interest which quickly propelled into a passionate obsession. I will avoid delving too much into my interest in GABA based anxiolytics but years of seeing friends lost to alcohol, watched others spiral out on certain benzodiazepines, reading Phenibut withdrawal horror stories, and, at the end of the day, feeling very not alone in wanting a better, safer, therapeutic anxiolytic.

**Enter GABAA positive allosteric modulators**

This [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/awt118/comprehensive_list_of_gabaa_receptor_anxiolytics/) written by u/CL20 was perhaps my first exposure to understanding benzodiazepine agonism/antagonism and the subunits of GABAA. I highly encourage everyone reading this to read his overview of GABAA subunits. The salient note is that agonism of the GABAA a1 subunit is most susceptible to tolerance buildup and addiction as well as responsible for sedation and memory impairment.

**Further reading**:

***Valium without dependence? Individual GABAA receptor subtype contribution toward benzodiazepine addiction, tolerance, and therapeutic effects***

>In the light of current evidence, α1 dormant, α2, α3, and α5 subtype partial agonists not only possess low abuse potential but are also low or devoid of tolerance building. There is evidence that α1 containing GABAA receptors directly contributes to the downstream effects of tolerance because α1 (H101R) mice have been shown to maintain expressions in neuroplasticity-coding transcripts after diazepam administration.120 This perfectly agrees with data from animal studies regarding the lack of tolerance in α1 subtype inactive compounds such as TPA023B and imidazenil.121–126 Future drug discovery involving tranquilizers should look for partial agonists of α2 , α3 , and α5 containing GABAA receptors; Valium without its side effects is potentially achievable.

**From Wikipedia**:

**Imidazenil**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-1) is an experimental [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) drug which is derived from the [benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as [midazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midazolam), [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil), and [bretazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretazenil).

Imidazenil is a highly potent [benzodiazepine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_receptor) [partial agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-2) with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as [anticonvulsant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [anxiolytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects, yet without any notable [sedative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative) or [amnestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnestic)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-3) effects. In fact, Imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of [diazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam), yet without lowering the convulsion threshold,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-4) and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist [flumazenil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumazenil) which is commonly used to treat [benzodiazepine overdose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_overdose) at present.

Imidazenil has not yet been developed commercially for use in humans, however it has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-5) a potent yet non-sedating anticonvulsant which might be particularly useful in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphate [nerve agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent),[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-7) and as a novel treatment for [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidazenil#cite_note-8)

**Experience**:

The synthesis for Imidazenil was not easy or quick. Nevertheless, I received a tested batch of the compound and have been evaluating it at various dosages. In my experience, the literature appears accurate. Here are my key takeaways after several weeks of near-daily use at various dosages, but mostly 500mcg-1.5mg. I rarely felt the need to increase my dosage beyond:

* A tremendous reduction in anxiety and ruminating thoughts. Very direct and targeted in this regard. If I could compare the anxiolytic effects to anything, I find 1mg of Imidazenil to be akin to \~1g of Phenibut combined with 50mg of Fasoracetam.
* No noticeable tolerance buildup whatsoever. Does not appear to synergize with alcohol….at all? THIS IS EXTREMELY ILL-ADVISED so please stay safe and don’t be stupid. However, I find Imidazenil appears to *increase* my tolerance to alcohol rather than decrease it. While I am obviously on the more cavalier side of this community, there is something about the effects of this compound that do not compel me to increase the dosage. I found the Goldilocks zone out of the box and have essentially stayed there.
   * Potential restoration of tolerance for other GABAergic compounds.
* I never experienced any loss of coordination, amnesia, or hypnotic effects. Again, it echoes the nootropic aspects of Fasoracetam.
* Definite and noticeable dopaminergic modulation. This compound plays *excellently* with all stimulants I combined it with, from pre-workouts to phenidates. Akin to caffeine + L-Theanine, Imidizaneil + DRIs produce a much less jaggy experience.  It almost reminds me of certain effects with low-dose Naltrexone.
* Paradoxical effects on energy. It wakes me up in the morning while nuking fogginess. It helps me fall asleep quicker and stay asleep.
* Increased libido and performance in the bed very similar to Phenibut. I have not noticed increased libido from any other GABAergic that I can think of.
* Discontinuation without tapering for over a week with no ill-effects.
* I am significantly less chatty on this compound. In social situations, I am clearly engaged but rather quiet. This is atypical for me.

**Conclusion**:

It is nice to finally experience another “next-generation” compound since the NSI-189, Dihexa, and P21 days. I realize this will be flagged as “high-risk” (as it should be), but as someone who previously vilified benzodiazepines and never considered seeking them out, I please encourage the more responsible members of this community to realize what this compound may mean for the safety of millions seeking relief from anxiety.

This is truly a special compound that is an improvement to traditional benzodiazepine anxiolytics in every way I can think of. By no means am I planning on staying on this for the rest of my life, but out of all my experiences with the subject matter related to this sub, this has been by far the most rewarding, interesting, and potentially game-changing discovery.

Looking forward to continuing this dialogue.",2019-10-27 07:05:37

I guess caffeine blocks serotonin & gaba in the short-term so you have less available... but then there's a long-term overcompensation effect so that on days where you don't drink coffee you have more GABA & Serotonin available?

Can somebody explain how to look at this?

I can only speculate that on the days where I stop caffeine I go into an overly parasympathetic but not very comfortable state (more gaba and serotonin release?) where I'm not particularly interested in doing anything at all (might be withdrawal tough)... my sleep is better too.

""Are there any nootropics to decrease my appetite while on a diet?""

""Are there any nootropics to help me get to sleep at night?""

""Are there any nootropics to help heal tendon injuries?""

""Are there any nootropics to make my girlfriend do anal?""


I may have made that last one up, but you get the point. The definition of ""nootropic"" is already kind of vague -- a drug that improves cognitive function -- but it seems that we are taking any specificity that's left out of the definition. ""Nootropic"" is being used to mean ""a drug that does what I want but lets me call it something else other than a drug."" I don't know if it's because people want to feel superior in some way, or they don't like to admit that they're using drugs, or what the reasoning is, but it seems like the word ""nootropic"" is quickly becoming totally meaningless here... there are more and more instances of the term ""nootropic"" being used simply as a synonym for ""drug"".


If you want a ""nootropic"" to reduce your appetite, you want an appetite suppressant or a stimulant, not a nootropic. Are some stimulants also nootropics? Sure. But not all.
If you want a ""nootropic"" to help you get to sleep at night, you want a tranquilizer/depressant, or some other drug that promotes sleep, not a nootropic.

Yes, drugs can be useful for these purposes... but unless these purpose involve *cognitive enhancement*, you aren't talking about nootropics, you're just talking about drugs.

The gradual yet not-so-subtle cognitive impairments of my magnesium supplementation,215,dvxtlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dvxtlb/the_gradual_yet_notsosubtle_cognitive_impairments/,128,1573706042.0,"I originally started taking magnesium to help me sleep, which it did, at first. It helped me fall asleep more quickly and also allowed me to fall back asleep earlier if I woke up before my intended waking time.

This obviously led to more sleep on average per night. I was also remembering my dreams better and feeling more rested in the morning. So I took it daily before bed (400 mg of this stuff [https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Best-Absorption-Magnesium-Glycinate/dp/B000BD0RT0](https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Best-Absorption-Magnesium-Glycinate/dp/B000BD0RT0)) for about 2 years.

I also felt that the Mag led helped curb some of my mild anxiety (which it's been shown to do [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27869100](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27869100)).

However, it didn't come without side effects. Over time, I started to suspect that both my memory and my verbal acuity were lapsing due to the magnesium. This was barely perceptible for a long time because, I believe, the effects were gradual, which allowed them to be normalized by my own perspective.

However, the effects became quite clear to me one time when I went without magnesium for the first time in over a year. I was on vacation and had forgotten to pack my magnesium so I went to bed without it, and the next morning I awoke to a sense of heightened cognitive functioning.

I was no longer pausing to search for the right word in conversation, which I then realized had become a frequent occurrence while supplementing magnesium, and even my internal monologue seemed much more fluid. I was able to form more robust ideas much more quickly, and I also felt that I was able to communicate them more clearly to others, largely because my memory was better and my recall was quicker.

Simply put, I just felt ""smarter"". And this feeling lasted for the duration of the vacation, although after a few days the lack of quality sleep became more apparent.

Since then I've experimented with smaller dosages and cycling magnesium, and there seems to be a tradeoff between the quality sleep and anxiolytic effects of supplementing magnesium vs the slight decrease in cognitive functioning and memory impairment.

I did a little research and found some studies that seem to support my hunches:

Magnesium competes to block synaptic functioning in the NMDA receptors ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261381](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261381)) which are crucial to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA\_receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor)).

So if you're taking magnesium I suggest experimenting with time off from supplementing and/or adjusting your intake. I had no idea that it was affecting me at all cognitively, and some of you may be in the same boat.

Would love to hear any thoughts you guys have about this.

Edit: The current top comment is claiming I am basing this on a single experience on vacation. The commenter apparently didn't read the paragraph a few above this one where I mentioned that I tried this altering the dosage and cycling afterwards. Nowhere in this post do I claim a monopoly on the truth. This was simply meant to be a launch point for discussion and the sharing of experiences.

Edit 2: if anyone started getting blue dots in their field of vision (particularly around the time you started taking magnesium) let me know. This happens pretty often when I stand up too fast, and I’m wondering if it’s related to magnesium supplementation.",2019-11-14 10:04:02

(Also not from an english speaking country so bear with me.)

As you can see in the title I have tried a list of substances (and other things) deliberately or accidentely against depressive symptoms (I wouldn't call it straight up depression but it dips into it sometimes). I'm writing this as a reminder to myself of what does and doesn't work and as advice for others. If a substance I listed is illegal in your country you probably don't want to expose yourself to legal issues for a chance at improving your depression if you haven't tried all legal routes.. (But what's legal and illegal is a pretty arbitrary line so I wouldn't absolutely advice against, just know what you're doing please. Inform yourself.)
Okay enough stalling, here it is:

Substances tried for a longer period (each day):

- Piracetam (with a choline source): maybe the first few days (attack-dose) a tiny bit of increase in visual sharpness and/or saturation? Didn't notice anything else above possible placebo limit. For me this was kind of a waste of time tbh. Might try again when I'm mentally deteriorating from old age.

- Lions mane. (Yes, ""the right one"", with the Nerve Growth Factor) This one did seem to work against depressive symptoms and anxiety a tiny bit. But after a week or two no noticable effects anymore.

- Microdosing (LSD, because it was the easiest to dose, more energetic than shrooms, dirt-cheap, long-lasting): Who knew putting an incredible potent mind-altering susbtance in 1/10 the usual amount in your brain really does some stuff? Too many people don't at least. This one increases mindfulness, sociability (because of increased interest in others) and creativity. It worked for me against depressive symptoms because it breaks me out of habits that play into the depressive symptoms. And the mindfulness helps against anxiety (but I can imagine how it can also work against you). The increased interest in stuff helps against ADHD a tiny bit, does nothing for focus though and with a bit larger doses is actually terrible for focus.

- Not a nootropic but should be noted anyways: exercise (strength training). Humans really have not evolved to thrive with doing nothing physically. You should be exercising, for your own sake. Obvious health benefits but more importantly: increased confidence (and this is major against depression and anxiety long term) and for the short term also a decrease in overthinking.

Once-in-a-while-use:

- Psychedelics (LSD and mushrooms primarily): The reason for this post. I was forgotten how extremely helpful they can be. Just a low dose of mushrooms has boosted my mindfulness for days (which decreases anxiety, which decreases depressive symptoms). I gained some perspective and can more easily 'shove away' thoughts that are unhelpful instead of them getting stuck in my head. This has worked time and time again, BUT there is the risk of a bad trip for inexperienced users and/or people who don't know what they're doing which can give someone PTSD. Other risks are negligible tho. Personally I don't feel like I could even get a bad trip (especially with the low-medium doses I do) because of pretty alright meta-cognitive skills (meditation, facing issues instead of hiding from them, seeing things in perspective, etc.), but again, evaluate the risks for yourself. Edit: stumbled upon [this](https://www.livescience.com/psilocybin-depression-breakthrough-therapy.html) just now, I swear I didn't plan it.

- MDMA: Probably great for PTSD and (other) emotional blockades (relationship troubles) but it did nothing really for me. I mean great experience but against depressive or anxiety symptoms it doesn't do shit long-term. You think in the moment ""I probably should do/react in this way instead of the inhibited/less-loving/less-open way I usually react"" but that's the you flooded with serotonin that doesn't get how the world (sadly) works (and you and other people when not on MDMA..).

- Edibles. I only included these to provide the most information I could but I don't think anybody considers weed as an option against depression.. And rightfully so, during the experience you're frustrated because you have a bit of the same motivation as psychedelics to do useful shit with your life but you're too incapable (physically and mentally) to do that, plan it or even remember it in a useful manner. And the next day you're slowly recovering, and being an incapable person (for at least two days) doesn't help against depressive symptoms... So no.",2019-11-27 06:59:19

>A form of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, with its own transporter.
Salmon roe is rich in the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA. Not all DHA forms are created equal, however. The DHA in salmon roe is in phospholipid form, which may play a unique role in human physiology. It turns out that humans and some animals have a transporter, called Mfsd2a, in their brains. This transporter targets the phospholipid form of DHA and moves it into the brain. Research has shown that animals that have been genetically modified to lack Mfsd2a transporters have 60% less DHA in their brains compared to normal animals. Other research shows that humans who have a mutation in the gene that encodes for the Mfsd2a transporter develop early neurodegeneration.

I've been dosing 200mg Modafinil for 12 months - My Personal Experience.,212,898l35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/898l35/ive_been_dosing_200mg_modafinil_for_12_months_my/,127,1522753651.0,"Hi there folks, I've been a reader here for quite a while but i haven't engaged a whole lot, however i feel as if i'm at a point where i can share an experience of mine with the use of Nootropics. This is going to be a relatively long post, however I will leave a Dot-point summary at the base.

I began using Modafinil (Modalert) close to 12 months ago, after hearing about it on a Podcast, and ignorantly and easily persuaded me decided to order some to try it out for myself. I'm going to start this with a brief experience overview followed by some Positives Vs. Negatives i have experienced.

**My overall experiences**

I take Modafinil two days per week, back to back at a 200mg dosage per day, generally at around 12pm (midday), often with or just after eaten lunch.

My initial experience for the first 4-6 doses was incredible, I 'felt' a difference, I could consciously feel myself paying far greater attention to my work (i was running a E-Commerce business at the time in addition to a Full-time job) and having little-to-no brain fog at all, which for me was an absolute godsend, as I am generally a pretty anxious/easily distracted person.

Skipping forward about 6 months, whilst still taking the same doses, at the same times, those feelings no longer come. If i think about it on a day to day basis, I am marginally more alert than without it, however if feels although the effects are no longer as strong as they once were - this could come down to my tolerance level, but I would have assumed taking it only twice a week, that I wouldn't build a tolerance... please let me know if I am wrong.

At this present moment in time, I continue to cycle Modafinil, at the same levels as before, on the same days. The story has not changed since 6 months ago.

------------------------------------

However, one thing I HAVE noticed, is that when I dose modafinil whilst working at my day-time job, on the days i dont regularly dose, the effects are greatly felt. I work in Sales, and the benefits are crazy. I am FAR quicker on my feet in terms of responses to questions from customers, i can bring product knowledge to my tongue lightning fast, I become more witty, I never get distracted and overall i just feel like i'm 'pingin''... the Benefits go on! I guess, I feel as though I become a well-greased wheel in my Sales role when using Modafinil - and my sales figures often represent higher conversions, higher ticket price sales, all the while being faster and obviously more effective. 

i've tested this theory many times in the last twelve months. It's important for me to mention that I have also ruled out a Placebo effect by blindfolding myself, and allowing housemates to give me either one dose of Modafinil or a common vitamin.

To cut the long story short, I feel as though the effects in my experience of using Modafinil have worn off greatly, again, this may be due to a tolerance build up, and I may have to step up my dosage to feel full effects. I feel although the drug is marketed in the wrong way - a lot of first time users assume they will have crazy super human abilities as depicted in movies - this for me is far from the truth. However general memory recall is raised marginally.

Summing up, for those who didn't want to read my poorly written essay:

**Positives** - 

- Marginally increased Memory Recall.
- When the dosage is right, and no tolerance is built up, I experienced laser like focus on my business work.
- Brain Fog decreases tremendously.
- Not a bad pre-workout (I say this half joking), I have felt an increased focus on lifting weights, better technique, and less overall awareness of being tired/less-energy, compared to normal workouts without dosing.
- Ability to talk faster
- Less time needed to think of answers on my feet
- Ability to recognise distractions and cut them out earlier than normal.

**Negatives** - 

- Problems sleeping from time-to-time.
- Brain fog the day after a dose upon waking
- I personally feel that in order to feel effects you cannot just take it and do a normal day - you need mental stimuli and to be working on a project that requires great attention to detail - this is when i notice the full effects.
- Urine smells like Acid.
- Headaches upon taking initial doses, also when not drinking enough water.

Thanks for allowing me to share, and if not for anything else i would love to hear your own personal takeaways from using Modafinil, and if anyone has information on Tolerance build up regarding my dosage, please let me know. I'm all ears.",2018-04-03 16:37:31

"If you're going to take a cold shower, take a cold shower.",211,5u6xmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5u6xmc/if_youre_going_to_take_a_cold_shower_take_a_cold/,163,1487188545.0,"I see lots of people saying they take cold showers but then reveal in actuality they do something like a 10 minute hot shower with a token 60 second cold finish or a few 30 second cold shots. It's a stretch to call this a cold shower and you are probably missing out on most of the benefits and just making yourself uncomfortable. This isn't about ego, it's about getting the therapeutic dose if you're going to put yourself through the discomfort of cold water in the first place. 

According to [Rhonda's paper](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/news/s/d5oth5/new_20-page_report_on_cryotherapy_just_released_cold_shock_boosts_norepinephrine_up_to_5-fold_increase_type_of_immune_cell_that_kills_tumor_cells) on this a lot of the good stuff happens around a 2 degree drop in body temperature and if you look at the hour long soaks at cold temperature it took to get there it's obvious a little 30-90 second exposure isn't going to do anything.

>It appears that a 2°F reduction in core body temperature is e nough to induce cold shock proteins, including RBM3, in human astrocytes (a type of brain cell). By way of example, in one study, young men that stayed submerged in cold water of 68°F (20°C) for one hour were able to l ower their rectal temperature to around 96.9°F (36.1°C) or if they stayed in 57.2oF (14oC) water for 1 hour they were able to lower their temperature to 96.1°F (35.6°C).

I did a big writeup here tracking my biometrics [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) mostly on sauna but I have a section on cold shower. About 10-15 minutes of straight cold in 57F shower water I was able to get to 97.1F core temp.

I have shitty tolerance for cold water but the miserableness goes away if you just stick it out for a couple minutes. I intended to 'ease in' my first time but after 30 seconds I just said fuck it and kept going and then got warm after a minute and went to a full 15 minutes. When you go hot cold you're just subjecting yourself to the worst part over and over and getting much less benefit. 

Unless you have one of those crazy showers that hits you from all angles or doing cold water immersion you're only getting focused cold application in one spot while the other 80% of you is in lukewarm purgatory so you need time for it to drop your body temperature.

Cold showers are such a powerful thing for your health, more powerful than any sleep supplement, nootropic, or fat burning supplement I've tried, and it's a shame to see most people simply not doing it right. Once you get to two minutes it's just as easy to go to 15. 

>But my water is reeeeeally cold

First, actually measure that shit because without a thermometer most people who haven't done much with cold water think their water is literally a just-shy-of-ice 35F when it's actually 70F (talking from experience). If you're in a standalone home in Minnesota then you have an excuse, or you are really lucky. If you live in a city, high rise, etc this is especially important as your water is probably a lot warmer. Second, cryotherapy chambers go to -264F and a session is 3 minutes, 2:30 for noobs. You should at the very least be able to make it to 6-10+ minutes in a steamy 60F shower.

Since this is /r/nootropics and you want a pill for everything, I've read that Tyrosine increases cold tolerance so this could take the edge off, but I haven't tried it. However, if you're doing this at night it might also keep you up and mess up the amazing sleep inducing benefit of cold showers.

Also, as I mentioned in my [previous writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/), the addition of a sauna followed by cold shower is a magnificent combination and makes the initial part much easier. 

It didn't do much for me but apparently Wim Hof breathing helps with pain tolerance. 

If your shower is much above 65F I honestly don't know if I would bother, I haven't found any research finding biochemical changes above that. I think above 65F the only cold shower benefits you are retaining are mental fortitude and nice skin/hair, which is still nice. You'd be better off just going outside for your cold exposure, though. In the summer I would look into ice baths or check out the Cool Fat Burner ice vest. 

There is an option if you do want super fast cold exposure and that is cold water immersion in very very cold water.

>There have been studies comparing the norepinephrine response to cold­water immersion (whole body submerged for 20 seconds in 40°F) with whole body cryotherapy (2 min at ­166°F) and found they are more or less identical, at least in that respect.

That is a lot of work, however, to set up for a 20 second dip and at that point you also might as well stay in for a full soak because

>Now, if you were to stay submerged in that cold water for an hour as opposed to just 20 seconds we know that norepinephrine would increase 5­fold. Which brings us back to the point that exposing the body to cold for prolonged periods may have a more robust effect.

One final trick you can do is drink a big glass of ice water before starting the shower. This will help increase the rate of cooling. 

tl;dr Stop pussyfooting around with the shower knob and just leave it on cold the whole time, it's less miserable than cycling and you might as well get the full benefits if you're going to make yourself miserable in the first place. 

PS. Body fat decrease after 6 weeks of sauna/cold shower
Since I linked to my previous [sauna+cold shower writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5ohi9a/home_heat_stress_training_and_cold_shower/) I figure I'd put an update in this post. I've continued my sauna+cold shower combo. I've averaged a bit more than every other day. I started this regimen after a couple months in a wheelchair and I was thoroughly deconditioned and my bodyfat had risen to 19-20% (using an omron handheld monitor). In about 6 weeks my last few readings have been 9.5-13%. I know these things aren't super accurate which you can see in the wide range but clearly this has shifted way beyond the error range. To put this into perspective I could never get it below 14% after months of workout out in prior years. This huge drop is despite not being in ketosis (though I am fairly low carb) and not being able to do 'big lifts' like deadlifts/squats (I've had to focus on upper body). So while I have optimized a lot of things I think clearly this heat/cold exposure training is having a massive effect. It feels like it is amplifying the exercise effects by a factor of two or more with less injury and a trivial amount of additional work.",2017-02-16 01:25:45

The Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Your GABA System (Reduce Anxiety),209,62w5lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/62w5lk/the_ultimate_guide_to_enhancing_your_gaba_system/,78,1491116043.0,"This is a complete guide that covers all of the best natural products that up-regulate and enhance GABAergic activity. I'm pretty sure nothing significant has been left out, but I will update it if something is pointed out to me that should have been included. Hopefully this will help a lot of you out and can be used as an effective guide to enhancing the system GABAergic. Enjoy!

So.

GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in humans. It reduces neuron excitation in most areas of the central nervous system, and blocks impulses between nerve cells in the brain. Low levels of GABA can be associated with anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy.

**The Function of GABAergic Medications**
 
Drugs that enhance the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid, such as *benzodiazepines* (benzos) like *diazepam* (Valium), at the GABA-A receptor result in sedative, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) and hypnotic (sleep-inducing) cognitive effects. As well as being useful in treating anxiety and insomnia, GABAergic drugs are also used to treat seizures, muscle spasms and alcohol withdrawal.
 
However, these drugs should only be taken for serious medical conditions, since they carry with them the risk of addiction. Furthermore, those wishing to improve their GABA system gradually over time, rather than treating it in the short-term, should also consider the dietary factors involved in the GABA system, and the natural methods we can use to enhance the GABAergic system.

**How Do We Produce GABA?**
 
GABA is synthesised in the brain from the amino acid glutamate using the enzyme *glutamate decarboxylase* (GAD), with *pyridoxine phosphate* (Vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Glutamate is synthesised from the essential amino acid *L-glutamine* using the enzyme *glutaminase*. [Image here](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/39c32c_c65a4a8a88a6409eab5bc88157db1d5b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_788,h_150,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/39c32c_c65a4a8a88a6409eab5bc88157db1d5b~mv2.png)

Treating anxiety sounds pretty simple then. Increase your intake of L-glutamine and you will have more resources to produce GABA, and increase your intake of pyridoxine and you will be able to convert more of the L-glutamine into GABA. 

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. 
 
The reason it's not that simple is that GABA can actually be converted back into glutamate in a process called the GABA shunt, and glutamate is also a neurotransmitter, but which has exactly the opposite effects of GABA.

**The Glutamate Paradox**
 
Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our nervous system. It is an important neurotransmitter for memory and learning because of the role it plays in neuroplasticity, but in excessive quantities it can lead to excitation problems such as anxiety disorders. 
 
The GABA shunt pathway usually keeps glutamate in check, but there are number of things that can aggravate this pathway. Lack of vitamin B6 is the most significant factor for insufficient conversion to GABA, but auto-immune dysfunctions can also inhibit the GAD enzyme, which catalyses this conversion. Food intolerances such as gluten intolerance, along with hormone replacement therapy, are notably responsible for this inhibition of GABA conversion. 
 
**GABA Transaminase Inhibition**
 
GABA begins its conversion back to glutamate through the action of the enzyme GABA transaminase. If this enzyme is inhibited, however, then GABA levels will remain at higher levels.
 
> *Lemon Balm* (or *Melissa officianalis*) and *Rosemary* (or *Rosmarinus officianalis*) contain the compound *rosmarinic acid*, which has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19165747)) to be a GABA transaminase inhibitor. This compound can reduce the rate at which GABA is shunted back to glutamate.
 
**GABA Receptor Agonism**
 
A method of increasing GABAergic effects, especially in the short-term, is by using GABA analogues that agonise GABA receptors.
 
A receptor agonist is a chemical that binds to a given receptor, activating it to produce a biological response. The nootropic drugs phenibut and picamilon are the best known agonists of both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, but there are also number of natural products that have proven effectiveness as GABA agonists.

> *Passion Flower* contains the flavonoid *chrysin*, which has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17966676)) to be a GABA-A receptor agonist.
 
> The amino acid *taurine* has also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18171928)) to be a weak agonist at GABA-A receptors.
 
**GABA-A Receptor Allosteric Modulation**

There are also a number of natural products available that act as GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs).

These modulators create an amplification in the effects of an agonist, increasing the activity of GABA-A receptors, and creating sedative and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects.

> *Valerian* contains two compounds—*valeric acid* and *valerenic acid*—that have been shown ([link to study](http://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2004&issue=02000&article=00016&type=Fulltext)) to be PAMs.
 
> *Kava* contains a class of compounds called *kavalactones* that have also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12383029)) to be PAMs.
 
> *Ashwagandha* (or *Withania somnifera*) contains several steroidal lactones called *withanolides*, particularly *withaferin A*, which have also been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20044800)) to be PAMs.
 
The class of drugs known as *benzodiazepines* (such as *diazepam*, or *Valium*), as well as alcohol, are also positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors.
 
**GABA Reuptake Inhibitor**
 
Reuptake inhibitors inhibit the reabsorption of a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the neuron after it has performed it's activity.
 
> *St John's wort* (or *Hypericum perforatum*) contains two compounds—*hyperforin* and *adhyperforin*—that have been shown ([link to study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/026988110101500109)) to induce noncompetitive reuptake of various monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin and GABA.

**L-Theanine**

One final consideration is *L-theanine*. *Theanine* is a highly effective nootropic that has a wide range of applications. It is commonly used in combination with caffeine due to it's synergistic effects, and its ability to reduce the negative effects of caffeine. It is commonly found in green and white tea.

It is a weak glutamate antagonist (it blocks the effects of glutamate) but this effect is too low to be wholly responsible for its calming effects. It has been shown ([link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182482)) to increase levels of GABA, dopamine *and* serotonin.
 
**Summary**
 
In summary, there are various methods involved in our ability to naturally enhance GABA function. Many of these methods work synergistically together to produce a greater effect than any one its own. Reuptake inhibitors work synergistically with receptor modulators, and precursors work synergistically with metabolic inhibitors. Combining several or even all of the compounds discussed, at lower doses, is surely a more effective method at enhancing the GABA system in both short and long terms.

Dissos might have an acute moodlifting effect, but on the long term antagonising NMDAR WITH RC DISSOCIATIVES WILL WORSEN DEPRESSION.**

Neither do the effects rely on (direkt) AMPA interaction (at least not to a significant degree, downstream effects aside).

One of ketamines metabolite, **(2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine** (of which's concetration, besides the 2r6r isomere, corrrelates with the antidepressant effect) is not significantly active at NMDAR. ***Mostly, it is a highly potent negative allosteric modulator of alpha7 nicotinic receptors. Inhibition of metabolism to HNK inhibited any antidepressent effect of Ketamine.***

&#x200B;

It has to be said tho that with racemic ketamine/R-Ketamine, 2R6R-HNK is formed, which actually *has relevant action on NMDAR (ki: \~7mcM), which is very weak compared to the affinity to alpha 7 (<1mcM).* Considering the S,S-Isomer is about equipotent and has no relevant action on nmdar, it might not be insignificant, but pretty much irrelevant at common concentrations.

&#x200B;

Other NAMs at nACh a7 have already been shown to have incredibly robust anti anxiety effects, where as ampakines failed to create sufficient antidpressant effects. I'd say case closed. (EDIT: TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT JFC) Either way, here's the evidence:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061505/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061505/)

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534778/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534778/)

&#x200B;

***EDIT: I've seen many comments saying that blocking of NK metabolism to HNK doesn't block the antidepressant action, but NK itself is very potent at alpha7 too. to put it simply, same action + more nmda action. And since 2s,6sHNK alone exhibits almost identical AD effects, and other NMDA antagonists don't, i believe we can rule out nmda antagonism. speculation. grain of salt. but logically, the only possible explanation i can think of given the (llimited) evidence.***

# EDIT: PROOF THAT ALPHA 7 NAMs EXERT POTENT AND IMMEDIATE ANTIDEPRESSANT/ANXIOLYTIC EFFECTS

&#x200B;

My takeaway:

&#x200B;

i've already known that alpha7 NAMs are effective as ADs/anxiolytics. Under normal conditions, HNK is the main mediator of AD effects. blocking metabolism of NK to HNK does yield the same AD effect, and since HK happens to be a very potent a7 inhibitory ligand as well, we can't rule out a7 activity. What we can rule out tho, is that NMDA antagonism does not yield the desired effects, which leaves us with a7 NAM as responsible MoA. Ket's potency at other known targets seems to be to weak to explain it's AD effect. Furthermore, AD effect timeline accurately correlates to concentration of NK/HNK relative to their potency at a7.

the fact that other a7 NAMs exert similar fast acting AD effects further strengthens my thesis.

In contrast to ketamine and norketamine, HNK is inactive as an [anesthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic) and [psychostimulant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychostimulant).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-LeungBaillie1986-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-Wainer2014-5) In accordance, it has only very weak [affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) for the [NMDA receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor) (Ki = 21.19 μM and > 100 μM for (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK and (2*R*,6*R*)-HNK, respectively).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-MoaddelAbdrakhmanova2013-6) However, HNK does still show [biological activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_activity), having been found to act as a potent and selective [negative allosteric modulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_allosteric_modulator) of the [α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-7_nicotinic_receptor) ([IC50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC50) < 1 μM).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-MoaddelAbdrakhmanova2013-6) Moreover, (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK was tested and was found to increase the function of the [mammalian target of rapamycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_target_of_rapamycin) (mTOR), a marker of the [antidepressant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant) activity of ketamine, far more potently than ketamine itself (0.05 nM for (2*S*,6*S*)-HNK, 10 nM for (*S*)-norketamine, and 1,000 nM for (*S*)-ketamine ([esketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esketamine)), respectively), an action that was observed to correlate closely with their ability to inhibit the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-PaulSingh2014-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-van_VelzenDahan2014-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-Anisman2015-9) This finding has led to a call of reassessment of the understanding of the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and their mechanisms.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-SinghZarate2014-10) However, subsequent research has found that [dehydronorketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydronorketamine), which is a potent and selective [antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist) of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor similarly to HNK, is inactive in the [forced swim test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_swim_test) at doses up to 50 mg/kg in mice, and this is in contrast to ketamine and norketamine, which are effective at doses of 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-pmid26240948-11)

In May 2016, a study published in the journal [Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)) determined that HNK, specifically (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, is responsible for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in mice; administration of (2R,6R)-HNK demonstrated ketamine-type antidepressant-like effects, and preventing the metabolic conversion of ketamine into HNK blocked the antidepressant-like effects of the parent compound.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) As (2R,6R)-HNK, unlike ketamine, is not an NMDA receptor antagonist, and produces no dissociative or euphoric effects, it has consequently been concluded that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may in fact not be mediated via the NMDA receptor.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) This is tentative, as confirmation that the findings translate to humans is still needed,[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-14) but it is notable that published human data show a positive association between the antidepressant responses of ketamine and plasma (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK levels.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ScienceDaily2016-13) In accordance with the notion that the NMDA receptor is not responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine, [dizocilpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizocilpine) (MK-801), which binds to and blocks the same site on the NMDA receptor that ketamine does, lacks antidepressant-like effects.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxynorketamine#cite_note-ZanosMoaddel2016-12) Moreover, the findings would explain why other NMDA receptor antagonists such as [memantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memantine), [lanicemine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanicemine), and [traxoprodil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traxoprodil) have thus far failed to demonstrate ketamine-like antidepressant effects in human clinical trials.\[12\]",2020-04-10 12:10:43

Black Seed Oil Has Repaired My Broken GABA System - Rebound Depression from Benzos No Longer an Issue,208,70kcqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/70kcqv/black_seed_oil_has_repaired_my_broken_gaba_system/,74,1505635553.0,"**Background:  I've always reacted abnormally badly to alcohol, benzos, barbiturates & Z-drugs like Ambien.  Next-day depression was HORRIBLE.  Like, suicidal depression and awful raging irritability after a single dose of a benzo or my migraine meds (Fioricet).  I'd put it on par with the MDMA-induced depression I've experienced.  Just sheer misery.  I already have depression, OCD & anxiety but depressants worsen all three severely.**  

I originally tried Black Seed Oil because it was said to potentiate kratom, but I found that it put me in a very low mood the first few times I used it, so I backed off.  Now I only take it on weekends--1.5 droppersful in the evening.  Think I started using it in May or June of this year.  

Even with my low/infrequent dosing, something big has changed.  I no longer experience those wild mood swings after taking benzos or Fioricet.  Even high doses.  (Don't get me wrong--I will NEVER get into the habit of abusing downers again.  That's not the point of this post).  I keep waiting & waiting for the other shoe to drop, but this effect is real & lasting.  

I am completely baffled how this oil could have such an effect on my GABA system.  The longer I took BSO, the less noticeable the depressed feeling would be after dosing.  Now I don't feel depressed at all when I take it.  

I've read that people with autism/Asperger's (which I have) [have messed up GABA systems] (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/a-brain-link-to-autism/), so maybe that was responsible for my horrid reactions to depressants.  I don't know, but the difference is night and day.  This supplement is so beneficial for my bizarre mood issues & could probably help certain types of depression too if taken consistently.  

Anyway, just wanted to share my experience.  I'm not a big supplement taker & have never noticed real effects from any nootropic/supplement I've tried (tianeptine excluded).  I've been a daily low-dose user of stimulants & opioids for the past 14 years, which I take along with my Prozac to help make me functional.  That combo works relatively well, but absolutely nothing I tried could offset those benzo-induced rebound symptoms.  

Black Seed Oil has now made it possible to take benzos on the rare occasions when truly I need to, such as when flying or going to the dentist.  And I can take my migraine meds without feeling like shit for the following 2 days.  That's worth so much to me.  I'm still in shock, honestly.  ",2017-09-17 13:35:53
I recovered from drug-induced cognitive damage with nootropics,204,6exryf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6exryf/i_recovered_from_druginduced_cognitive_damage/,168,1496472769.0,"The purpose of this post is twofold: First, to briefly thank this subreddit for all of the incredible knowledge it lent me, and second, to outline my recovery from drug abuse and the nootropics I used to do it.

Some background on the extent of my damage: For about two years I abused just about every abusable drug know to man. I'd enjoyed drug use responsibly for years, and I would like to state that I draw a very distinct line between ""drug use"" and ""drug abuse"" even now. Responsible use requires monitoring and knowledge of drug effects on your cognition and impacted receptors. Abuse takes place when one knowingly goes too far for the sake of some escape or solace, and I'm a firm believer that the root of most (at least, non-prescribed) addiction is depression, and that one is unlikely to treat the symptom that is addiction without also addressing this source. I lost my balance following a traumatic time period that caused me to throw caution to the wind and suppress my misery by any means necessary. Even this began with some degree of responsibility - an alternating schedule of benzos, opiates, and dissociatives that allowed for at least three days between the usage of each class. Also, loads of weed. As most here probably know already, this sort of schedule is inadequate for avoiding addiction and is unlikely to be maintained. I did not maintain it, and carefully-metred drug use gradually declined into wanton polydrug abuse that royally fucked up just about every critical neurotransmitter you could name. What followed was extreme anhedonia, depression, and anxiety, and being quite unsure that I'd ever feel normal again.

From this point, it took me about a month to feel like recovery was well within my grasp, and three months to recover 100%. It's been some time now and I feel confident in saying that nootropics and good habits not only restored me to a healthy state of being, but have boosted my cognitive state well beyond where I was at prior to that whole depressive mess. I won't be providing any tests or measurable evidence because my only metric was ""feeling okay"" again, and I traveled such a gulf of misery to get there that I need no such validation.

I've seen a lot of folks here ""try"" this or that, bit of bacopa here, bit of piracetam there, etc. I've gotta say up front: You have to throw the book at this stuff. If you're fucked up and you know it, what isn't worth recovery? Balanced nutrition, exercise, and a slew of healing chemicals are your best bet for climbing out of a seemingly unscalable pit. All at once. Some of these things might make you feel worse before you feel better, and some things will make you feel better, but either have no long-term benefits or can result in actual harm. All of the following information is subjective; I can only say what worked for me and what I concluded from independent research and the good folks here on Reddit. Without further ado, here is a rundown on what I tried in order of perceived efficacy.

**Recreational drug abstinence:** Maybe it need not be said, but this is step one. If you are coming off of benzos or opiates, TAPER. Cold turkey is not the way to go with these things if you're in deep. Cut anything else right out... Although I will say that ketamine can be immensely helpful in staving off withdrawal symptoms during taper, using an addictive recreational substance to get off of addictive recreational substances is a very dodgy call. The real road to recovery doesn't start until you're free of everything.

**BPC-157:** This stuff is a miracle. I used it for about four weeks and gained sustained benefits. For the first five days or so, the side effects were not positive - fatigue, increased depression, brain fog, several of the things I was trying to heal. Thereafter I found my circadian rhythm restored, and the real benefits began. In fact, ""restored"" isn't even the right word. I've always had trouble sleeping, and suddenly I found myself becoming tired after dark and rising rejuvenated with the sun. Mood stability increased massively and my urges to get high all but disappeared. In addition, the soft tissue healing properties reversed long-standing injuries that prevented vigorous exercise, which leads me to...

**Exercise:** Opiates and weed essentially replace the ""runner's high"", and intense cardio is immensely important when attempting to recover from their absence. It's critical that you get opiate and cannabinoid receptors used to getting their fix from their natural source. A mile a day in the morning will accelerate healing rapidly.

**Black Seed Oil:** A teaspoon of this stuff granted me instant relief from symptoms of GABA downregulation. Again, I would strongly recommend using this WITH other balancing agents such as BPC and bacopa. It's hard to go overboard on recovery when you've gone overboard on destruction.

**Bacopa:** Similar to the above, but with more side effects. Heavily sedating, I continue to take this, but do so in the evenings so that the drowsiness doesn't inhibit my daytime productivity. I'll note that users seem to have extremely varied responses to this stuff. If it doesn't seem to work for you, give it a while. If you have intensely adverse reactions, give it up. There are other options that are more objectively effective.

**Noopept:** Of all the ""stimulating"" nootropics I tried, this came with the most positive cognitive side effects. In fact, I started using this prior to attempting any other solutions, so I have some idea of its efficacy alone, which is significant. Anxiolytic and anhedonia-relieving. Don't overdo it! I've read many reports of responders to this substance turning themselves into non-responders with overuse. I had great results at first with 30 mg/day in the morning, five days a week, with two days off, two months at a time. Nowadays I use just 10mg/day. With responsible use it seems to become more effective over time. Sometimes I like to stagger more (3-4 days on, 3-4 days off) so that there is no perceivable ""crash"" when I take a month off.

**Choline/Uridine/Fish oil stack:** Man, they aren't kidding when they call this stuff the building blocks of neurogenesis. I found this to be a very effective combo SPECIFICALLY when combined, and I credit it with a great deal of lasting benefits. After a couple of months, this stack started to jazz me up a bit too much, so I dropped it, but cognitive benefits remained thereafter.

**Semax/Selank/P21:** I had high hopes for all of these, and all were helpful in their own way, but I can't say I've noticed any long-term benefits from any of them. Then again, I used a whole lot of shit, so it's hard to say. I found these a bit racey when used repetitively, so I eventually prefered to cycle between them over daily use of any individual peptide. They're great for those times off of noopept.

**Magnesium:** Excellent for GABA repair in reasonable doses. Perceivable effects are somewhat subtle compared to everything I've already mentioned, but I've certainly found no drawbacks to daily use.

**B-Complex:** With an emphasis on B12, this stuff is brain juice. I don't have a lot to add. Its benefits are well-documented and prolific. Aim for capsules and sublingual tablets over pressed pills for maximum bioavailability.

**Ashwagandha:** This stuff is great for GABA, but I have doubts as to the wisdom of long-term use. Its calming effect is acute with use and I perceived a minor withdrawal upon discontinuation. No big deal, good for temporary relief either way. I think it may have slowed my overall recovery however. I noticed faster improvements after I dropped it. It's hard to say for sure whether or not these observations are valid. Such is the main drawback to attempting everything at once.

**Lion's Mane and Cordyceps:** These are two highly-reputed brain-boosting fungi. I can't say as I noticed any obvious benefits upon their addition, but I also can't say there weren't any. Who knows? Didn't hurt, that's for sure. It should also be noted that I've had visual snow since childhood (very much not from psychedelic use), and some folks said Lion's Main in particular helped with this. Such was not the case for me, but it could be the case for someone who specifically suffers from HPPD.


Alright! That wraps up the list of beneficial things. I'd like to take a moment now to list a few things I've seen recommended here that I would specifically avoid to people aiming for healing.

**Weed:** Yes, I already mentioned drug abstinence, but this one bears special mention because so many people treat it as benign. For one, it interacts poorly with BPC-157 in my experience. It also has an effect on GABA and will exacerbate withdrawal symptoms from benzos and such. In the case of the latter, it can be quite harmful. And good luck ridding yourself of anhedonia permanently if you have a weed habit. It's a quick fix, but a major drawback in the long run. If you must smoke it, do so well after recovery is achieved.

**Phenibut:** You guys, seriously. This stuff can be just as harmful to GABA receptors as benzos. Don't do it if you're recovering. Not even a little bit. It's not worth it.

**Caffeine/Nicotine:** I'm unsure why these classify as nootropics to some. Habitual use of either is clearly detrimental, and no justification is necessary therein. Dopamine imbalances at the very least are likely to ensue. That said, Semax/Selank both boost the effects of these tremendously, for better or for worse.

**Alcohol:** Modern drug culture may not call this a drug, but it is, and it will specifically inhibit GABA recovery. No bueno, sirs and madams.

**Tianeptine:** No one with a prior opiate addiction should touch this stuff. It may be a mild agonist, but it isn't mild enough. There are safer - if less effective - over the counter antidepressants out there. Opiate receptors take a very long time to recover from abuse, and I'm not sure as yet that I can see opiate usage ever becoming safe for a former addict again. The brain is quick to fall back into old habits in this regard, even with irregular use.


All I can really say in addition to all this is: Eat healthy as fuck. Avoid wheat if you're capable, and at the very least avoid products using enriched flour. Whole foods are your friend (and I don't mean the super expensive regal hippie store). People have varying opinions on fasting, but I've found five-day juice fasts to offer very quick relief from negative symptoms. Couldn't hurt to kick off a recovery regimen with one. At the very least, the calorie deficiency leaves one little energy for anxiety. I'm not going to provide a full nutrition guide here because it's not the place, but do your homework and do your body right. It has the ability to heal itself when given the implements to do so.

Thanks again, everyone. I hope this information is helpful. It should be noted that I've also found positive acute results from L-Theanine and ALCAR, but never used either to an extent that qualifies me to speak on them. They didn't blow my mind or anything. Although, if you are suffering severely troubled sleep (constant waking, nasty nightmares), do give L-Theanine a try in the night. It seems to have a calming effect on the dream state.

A little woo-woo sidenote: A lot of the fallout from drug abuse comes from bad cognitive habits. The brain works best when worked like a muscle. When you feel capable, read stimulating books, watch thought-provoking television, and set yourself to learning and self-improvement. A little meditation never hurt anyone :)",2017-06-03 12:22:49
Pharmacist Nootropic Input Website/Blog?,206,5quxj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5quxj4/pharmacist_nootropic_input_websiteblog/,65,1485740298.0,"Hey, everyone. US Pharmacist here. 

Been using Nootropics for about 5 years now. Whenever I add a new one, I usually spend a good amount of time researching it. The one thing that has been itching/bothering me, during my research, is the lack of scientific evidence or the massive amount of pseudoscience. I realize I do not have the resources to extensively research these compounds, e.g., a clinical trial, but I feel I may be able to connect the dots for a lot of people. 

I have been playing with the idea of starting a blog/website that I would do some write ups on the compounds/research. I would be open to suggestions on the subject matter of the articles. I have access to a lot of academic databases for articles and also the pharmacist thought process would be a unique addition. Would this be of interest to some of you? Just want to get a feel for things before I invest the massive amount of time. 


**TLDR:** Pharmacist. Love nootropics, hate pseudoscience and hand waving. Should I make a nootropic website with evidenced-based claims?

**Edit**: A lot of interest. 

- I need some people to play devil's advocate. What are the foreseeable problems? Is there a website/podcast that currently does this?
- Someone link me to some good tutorials on website/blog design, please. I am pharmacist, not a web designer :)
-  I have some PhD pharmacology graduate student friends that can maybe write some guest posts with some financial persuasion e.g., I buy them lunch haha.

**Edit2:** Looks like I am going to go through with this depending on my free time. 
My tentative plan:

- This would be different from Examine by being more personalized. I would take input from the public/you guys and gals, and write a personalized article with my pharmacist spin on things. I would have guests articles from different professions/fields (thank you guys/gals for the inbox love). I see Examine more as a database whereas my site would stimulate intellectual conversation on Nootropics. 

- An analogy: imagine you are picking up your prescription. Examine would be the giant packet of information you get with your drug, my site would stand as the quick personalized conversation you have with the pharmacist upon picking up your prescription.  

-  I would like to do a monthly literature review on Nootropics e.g., new ""studies"" or research

- Once this grows, we could find some financing model that would allow for free 3rd party testing of Nootropic suppliers and maybe some sort of stamp of approval(?).

- Always open to suggestions. Stay tuned.

[ » penultimate part ]
● Hello dear NootHeads, I’ve been trying a few Nootropics those last years to find out my ultimate stack, since everyone’s chemistry is different, and I thought that some people in this amazing group would like my personal and subjective view of the ones I tried so far. I always make good amount of research before buying products/compounds and I use only the best brand possible even if it’s more expensive… Priority for my health!

Phenibut: I really liked it. It gave me a huge anxiolytic and calming effect. It took around 3 hours to work and it is very useful when it’s time to speak in front of people, since it relieves all stress and anxiety. My dosage was 500mg for the nootropic purpose.

PRL-8-53: By far the best Nootropics I have taken for short term memory. Combine with Coluracetam to avoid building tolerance is even more powerful. The best combo for stuying. (8mg)

Galantamine: This one I used it only before sleeping. It give some incredible vivid dreams. To maximize the effects, one should take it in the middle of the sleep cycle. (waking up 4 hours after falling asleep) (7mg)

Sulbutiamine: At first, I was disappointed, but I continue to try it out every now and then and I can say that it works great. Nice boost of energy and motivation. (200mg)

Alpha GPC: My principal source of Choline. It really helps me to be clear headed. (600mg)

Pramiracetam: I liked it for the good memory enhancement but I felt like a zombie, no emotion, irritable, frustraded for nothing etc. On that I became an analytical Robot. (250mg)

Ginkgo: This one I tried it once, after a couple of researches I conclude that it wasn’t necessary with the Nootropics that I already had… (30mg)

Lion’s Mane: This one too, I tried it once. Since its and BDNF and NGF and I was already on Noopept. It have great potential but need to do complete cycle. (3000mg)

Aniracetam: I didn’t hate it, nor like it, I didn’t feel an effects or what’s so ever, maybe a more relaxing mood. (Taken for a month) (1300mg)

Coluracetam: My favorite Racetam family! HD vision, mood, choline uptake, memory and an amazing anxiolytic effect. Note that I feel like I can read people more easily on that. (3mg)

Noopept: I really like Noopept, even if I feel a bit robotic mood-like it’s worth the shot (Taken for 1 month on 1 month off) (30mg)

Fish Oil: General health and good to put in a stack.

Super B12 Sublingual: Very effective taken in the morning, it gives a little smooth boost and restart the circadian cycle. (1mg in the morning)

L-theanine/Suntheanine/L-theanine Sublingual:: The best ROA for me was the sublingual solution. Simple way to relieves stress. (100mg)

Super Rhodiola Sublingual: Very effective taken in the morning, it gives a little smooth natural energy boost (20mg)

Tianeptine Sodium: Very effective too for the mood. (12.5mg)

Memantine: Didn’t get the effect I thought. (10mg)

Kava Kava: Subtile, almost non-existent. (300mg)

Picamilion: Same. (300mg)

Sunifiram: Pretty good, but drop it for health concern. (Tumors related) (10mg)

Magnesium L-Threonate: Best form of magnesium. Pretty effective. I take it before bed. A bit expensive though, Glycinate form is close to its effective and is way cheaper. (150mg)

Quercetin: High source of vitamin C, Antioxidant that reduces neurotoxicity. (1,136-2,272mg)

R-Alpha-Lipoic-Acid: Powerful antioxidant (300mg)

5-HTP: Helps restore serotonin levels. (300mg)

ALCAR: A great supplement that I often use. I feel more focus on it, it’s a great supplement. I noticed that when I use ALCAR, it increase in some way the BBB and makes the Nootropics works even better, but it’s just a subjective thought, I need to do more research on the mechanism. (1000mg)

NALT: Good to synergise a stack. Very good for young healthy people. There is scientific evidence for helping creativity. (500mg)
Ubiquinol QH-Absorb: Didn’t feel more energetic on it. It say that it increase the production of mitochondria in the body. (100mg) (http://www.reddit.com/…/fact_check_please_700_words_on_coq…/)

Spirulina: High source of Vitamin. (1-8 g per day)

Echinacea Complex: Good for immune support (400mg)

Ashwagandha KSM-66: My favorite natural Nootropic along with Bacopa. (250mg)

PhenylPiracetam: I loved PhenylP. Nice energy boost and concentration. It keeps me focus without jittery. (100mg)

PhenylPiracetam Hydrazide: tried once. Potentially better than the non-Hydrazide one. (100mg)

Coleus Forskohlii: Nothing (500mg)

Epicor: Very good for immune support, health support. (500mg)

Bacopa (Bacognize): It was part of my night stack. After a complete cycle, I can’t really say that I had a huge cognitive increase, the effects were most likely very subtle. But the calmness that it gives me is very interesting. In the recent researches I made, I learned that I must take it during 3 months to feel the get the effects. (300mg)

NSI-189 : Decided avoid it for the moment. I have no major injuries nor drug abuse damage related. (20mg)

Dihexa: Same thing^ (?)

Modafinil : Very effective. It isn’t technically a Nootropics, but the concentration and focus are very pronounce and I can easily sleep at night with it. (100mg)

IDRA-21 : I did 3 or 4 days consecutive on it and it stopped due to some negative manic side effects. Also I suspect that I am allergic to Ampakines due to the itchy feeling on it. (7mg)

Caffeine/NALT Sublingual: Very handy and useful, also very effective. (430mg)

N-Acetyl-Semax Nasal: Very subtle. I doesn’t ‘’feel’’ it. I am maybe a little more focus and alert, but it can easily be Placebo effect. (2-3 sprays)

N-Acetyl-Selank Nasal: This one is very interesting, it is one of my favorite noots so far, and the anxiolytic effect pair well with the focus. I like it. (2-3 sprays)

Pyritinol: This is one of my favorite Nootropics too, mix with ECGC and ALCAR makes a very good stack! (600mg)

Green Tea (50% polyphenols, 35% catechins, approximately 20% of which is the important EGCG fraction): Good to synergise a stack or to pair with 5-htp. (500mg)

Tianeptine Sulfate form salt: I prefer this salt form. It is, in overall, better than the sodium. No need to redoes 3 times a day with this one. (41.25mg)

Noopept Nasal: This ROA is way more effective than any other administration. This is now the way to go for me with Noopept. (2-3 sprays)

Unifiram : So far, it feels more ‘’cleaner’’ than Sunifiram, awesome mental energy, I get less mentally tired with it and the concentration I get from it is on point. (7mg)

● Those are the ones that I have not tried yet:
-Bromantane : (tried some sample, but I need a complete cycle to see the effects) (50-100mg)

The above link is the news article that helped me find the study, below is the actual study link, please read them.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0093775417301367



Encouraging results:

To test their theory, the researchers conducted a trial on 12 women who had recently received a diagnosis of stage 0 or stage 1 breast cancer, and who were awaiting surgery for the disease.

For 3 weeks between their breast cancer diagnosis and surgery, each woman received NAC. The medication was administered intravenously at a dose of 150 milligrams per kilogram once weekly. On days when the subjects did not receive NAC intravenously, they received a twice-daily oral dose of 600 milligrams.

Biopsies of each woman's breast cancer tumor were taken both prior to and during surgery, and the researchers analyzed them for levels of three biomarkers of cancer aggressiveness: MCT4, CAV1, and Ki67.

The study revealed that levels of Ki67 in the tumors had reduced by 25 percent, while levels of MCT4 were reduced by a whopping 80 percent.

These findings indicate that treatment with NAC could be an inexpensive, non-toxic way to stop cancer cell growth and division.

Brain Cancer study: 

https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13046-018-1016-8

Results

Our data showed that NAC could decrease the protein level of Notch2. Meanwhile, NAC had a decreasing effect on the mRNA and protein levels of its downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1. These effects caused by NAC were independent of cellular GSH and ROS levels. The mechanism of NAC-mediated Notch2 reduction was elucidated by promoting Notch2 degradation through Itch-dependent lysosome pathway. Furthermore, NAC could prevent proliferation, migration, and invasion and might induce apoptosis in GBM cells via targeting Notch2. Significantly, NAC could suppress the growth of tumor in vivo.

Conclusions

NAC could facilitate Notch2 degradation through lysosomal pathway in an antioxidant-independent manner, thus attenuating Notch2 malignant signaling in GBM cells. The remarkable ability of NAC to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth may implicate a novel application of NAC on GBM therapy.

Gastrointestinal cancer: 

https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13046-014-0092-7

Results

Bromelain and N-acetylcysteine significantly inhibited cell proliferation, more potently in combination therapy. Drug-drug interaction in combination therapy was found to be predominantly synergistic or additive. Mechanistically, apoptotic bodies were detected in treated cells by TUNEL assay. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed diminution of cyclins A, B and D, the emergence of immunoreactive subunits of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8 and cleaved PARP, withering or cleavage of procaspase-9, overexpression of cytochrome c, reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-survival phospho-Akt, the emergence of the autophagosomal marker LC3-II and deregulation of other autophagy-related proteins, including Atg3, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and Beclin 1. These results were more prominent in combination therapy.

Conclusion

We report for the first time to our knowledge the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of bromelain and N-acetylcysteine, in particular in combination, on a panel of gastrointestinal cancer cell lines with different phenotypes and characteristics. These effects apparently resulted from cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Towards the development of novel strategies for the enhancement of microscopic cytoreduction, our results lay the basis for further evaluation of this formulation in locoregional approaches to peritoneal surface malignancies and carcinomatosis.

Lung cancer: 

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcb.240590805

Lung cancer arises as a focal transformation of chronically injured epithelium with cigarette smoke as one of its well‐recognized causes. Apart from oxidants (free radicals), cigarette smoke contains such a multitude of (pre)carcinogens that it is astonishing that not every heavy smoker becomes a victim of malignancy. This points to the interindividual variability in susceptibility to carcinogens; several lines of evidence suggest that metabolic factors are involved in such variability. Metabolism of carcinogens as well as the subsequent (multi)steps of carcinogenesis are affected by host factors and governed by the balance between opposing forces, such as metabolic activation and detoxification, formation and scavenging of radicals, and DNA damage and repair, which seem to imply that carcinogenic compounds can initiate tumor growth only in amounts saturating detoxification mechanisms. In this context it is well known that glutathione (GSH) plays a crucial role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. N‐Acetylcystiene (NAC), an aminothiol and synthetic precursor of intracellular cysteine and GSH, has been used for many years in Europe as a mucolytic drug. Clinically, it is a safe agent without major side effects and has been considered to have a place in cancer prevention, too. The antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties of NAC could be ascribed to multiple protective mechanisms, such as NAC nucleophilicity, antioxidant activity, its ability to act as a precursor of intracellular reduced GSH, modulation of detoxification, and DNA repair processes. On these grounds, NAC has emerged as a most promising cancer chemopreventive agent. Since 1988, NAC has been tested in a large European chemoprevention study (EUROSCAN) involving high‐risk individuals to prevent the occurrence of a second primary (lung) cancer. Toxicity data of this and other studies confirm that a long‐term daily usage of NAC in a 600mg dose is safe and may be recommended for clinical chemopreventive research.

Two years of Modafinil use. A positive physiological and psychological addiction.,208,7jz4bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7jz4bg/two_years_of_modafinil_use_a_positive/,122,1513365858.0,"This is my experience and I am not speaking for anyone else. I have been taking Modafinil (Modalert 200mg) for just over 2 years. Normally twice a week but in recent months about 3-4 times a week. 

The effect on any given day depends on two things: Amount of sleep and my mood. I have realised that almost every time the experience was slightly different. 

How Modafinil affects me: 1) After a day on Modafinil I sleep extremely well. 2) I have extremely clear thoughts the whole day. I can approach difficult issues in a clear and lateral way and find insightful solutions easier. It does not necessarily increase my focus when working. (Writing etc) Its a thinking drug for me. 3) I am alert and aware unlike anything I can put into words. 4) Taking it with L Tyrosine takes motivation to the next level. It is really incredible. And herein lies the problem.

The Problem: I suffer almost no side effects from Modafinil. In fact, I enjoy it so much that I have started increasing the dosages from twice to about 4 times a week. No tolerance issues. There should not be any tolerance issues with a drug like modafinil as it is prescribed for daily use. My physiological and psychological enjoyment have made me realise that I feel sometimes that I need to take it. Herein lies the biggest issue: Dependence. This is a great realisation I had whilst being on Modafinil.

I have now decided to take a break from Modafinil for 6 months. It is a sad goodbye from a good friend. There is so much info about modafinil and its effects. What I love about Reddit is the fact we can share the experience and learn from each other. I for one will always love Moda.",2017-12-16 00:54:18

Lack of concentration, terrible procrastination, feeling of underachieving and later depressive episodes resulting from it (not the other way around) are the issues I have been struggling with for a long time. Only recently, after getting diagnosis of ADHD and getting medicated for it, my life started improving tremendously.

Anyway, recently I started reading more about nootropics, and I realised that the reasons why people are looking into *smart drugs* are often the reasons why I decided to seek professional help.

I'm wondering for how many people the underlying condition, often undiagnosed, is the push to look for help, and how many people are simply, for one reason or another, trying to work or study in a manner simply unsustainable for a healthy non-superhuman?

For one, it induces a psychedelic state of mind,  which is fun. Aside from that, it has a slew of benefits that are rather surprising. For example, it stimulates hippocampal neurogenisis which not only improves working memory, but slows the aging process of the brain. As any of you may know, the brain shrinks every year simply because it loses cells, like your body, but never replaces them. Increased neurogenisis, or the release of young neurons can fill some of these gaps, and while not a solution, certainly slows the progression. Additionally, it grows the hippocampus which leads to better emotional regulation, and potentially memory formation. It seems to even improve white matter connections leading to better verbal fluency. 

While many of these things likely arent what they seem, the increased size of multiple brain regions (hippocampus, frontal lobe, other areas I cant remember) certainly is. 

Anyway, its a worthwhile ability to learn, and is rather simple if you find the right technique. This one is great, https://youtu.be/1vx8iUvfyCY

I'm not mentally sad, but for the past 3 years I've been low energy mentally. Physically I could summon energy considering I was a collegiate runner and have PRs of a  15:12 5k and a 2:45 marathon.

I just felt my nutrition went to shit while running in college and there were weeks were I'd only be eating top ramen and emailing my coach for food.

The first night I started supplementing with magnesium I felt sudden jerks in my chest and legs 😅 Then I'd feel like, my brain was just having an electric rush. I went to bed and had some very vivid dreams.

Then I started naturally waking up at 6 am like my pre-college years. It was so fucking weird. Like, I'd wake up fully rested and with the amount of energy as 18 year old me.

I'd sustain this mental energy throughout the day too, which was just weird as hell.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone else has felt this? I'm also supplementing with vegan iron supplements, B12, l-theanine, vitamin C, fish oil, calcium, and vitamin d.

My Observations on Vitamin C After 2 Years of Use,203,bfgtwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bfgtwk/my_observations_on_vitamin_c_after_2_years_of_use/,159,1555821665.0,"I've been taking Vitamin C for 2 years now and it is undoubtedly my favourite supplement. I take 1000mg of Ascorbic Acid every morning, along with 100mg of bioflavonoids and 25mg of Rosehips. This is a timed release caplet that spreads the dose out over a 6-8 hour period.

Here are my observations. Keep in mind that these are anecdotes and thus subject to the placebo effect. That being said, this experience is stretched over 2 years, with a noted reduction in these effects without use, and an increase with use, consistently.

**Benefits:**

* Improved stress tolerance. I am able to study longer and tackle more projects without becoming overwhelmed. I feel calmer. This is different from my experience with ashwaghanda which makes me feel lazy, tired, and apathetic. Vitamin C seems to simply increase my stress threshold, I assume due to cortisol mediation. 

* Reduced allergies. I have better energy and less hayfever symptoms during the spring and summer. I used to wake up sneezing regularly and now I rarely, if ever, have these symptoms. I attribute this to histamine regulation. 

* Improved mood. This may also be related to the reduction in stress and histamine levels, but I consistently notice a mood boost from Vitamin C. It gives a subtle but noticeable feeling of relaxation. 

* Better energy overall. This could be due to the above mentioned factors, as well as the antioxidant activity/glutathione boosting effect. 

**Side Effects:**

* None that I have observed. There is some literature that suggests a correlation between [Vitamin C and oxalate renal stones.](https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/15/12/3225.long) However there is some doubt about the methodology of the study, as well as the fact that Ascorbic Acid can [reduce the formation of certain types of stones.](http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v09n05.shtml) It also appears that there is no known risk of increased renal stones from [intravenous Vitamin C.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5981254/)

Something to note as well is that the researchers found no correlation between high Ascorbic Acid intake from food and oxalate stones. This suggests to me that theoretically, taking Ascorbic Acid with high doses of cofactors as well as a meal containing fibre could mitigate this risk. 

Overall, Vitamin C is cheap, beneficial, and consistent. If you have any issues relating to histamine I would suggest trying a good quality brand of Ascorbic Acid with cofactors.",2019-04-21 10:11:05

I slipped my grandma with dementia some Alpha GPC in her drink and this is what happened.

My grandma is 89 years old and her mind is almost totally gone. She has good days and bad days, and today was a ***bad*** day. We invited all the family over for Christmas dinner and my grandpa told me when they arrived *“Careful, grandma is going into orbit.”* I can tell it’s bad when she starts to repeat her home address over and over again or she forgets that I’m married, and she also curses a lot. She is also *super irritable* during these times, and can be really mean to the family. I was sitting down eating and talking with my aunt and she was really frustrated with my grandma because she had been watching her all day, and she was pretty snappy. I was telling my aunt about Alpha GPC and how it helps with memory, and she jokingly mentioned that I should slip some in her drink. I told her I had some, and we both just sort of laughed and looked at each other. Then she said “No really, it would be really helpful to me. Please go get it. She won’t notice it.” So I put 150 mg of Alpha GPC from Nootropics Depot in her juice, and she couldn’t taste a difference. Drank it all.

Sure enough about 20 minutes later she was calm and collected. I don’t think she’d be able to name off everybody in the room, but she wasn’t obsessing over where she was, or who this person or that person was. Or cursing at family which was nice. 

I found [this study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00207454.2013.765870) and a few others that confirm Alpha GPC’s benefits for people with dementia. Maybe don’t do what I did though, this was a bit of an “emergency”...

***Update***: She’s gone home now and some of the things I noticed were...

1) ***She wasn’t obsessing over where she was***, like she usually does. She always forgets which state she’s in, and if she’s still living in Rochester, New York or not. She didn’t ask about that while she was here.

2) ***She didn’t recite her address over and over again***. This one was big because it’s really sad when she does this. She’s really afraid of forgetting where she lives.

3) ***She still repeated certain stories and phrases.*** She tends to tell the same 4 or 5 stories over and over, and that didn’t change.

Swanson's Lack of Transparency,205,6rw8t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6rw8t0/swansons_lack_of_transparency/,59,1502019451.0,"http://imgur.com/xHjmWkV

I frequently get this sort of response when I ask for CoAs from vendors and manufacturers, and it reeks of arrogance to me, that they feel they don't have an accountability to the consumer to demonstrate the safety of their products and the trustworthiness of their practices.

Of course, they don't actually have that accountability unless we enforce it, which is why I'm posting this here. I'm hoping that this can start a dialogue about how we can encourage companies to not only engage in good business practice, but be willing to be transparent about it also (within reason of course). After all, we are trusting them to the point that we ingest their products.",2017-08-06 17:07:31

I always put off buying a good quality B supplement because I assumed I was getting them from diet. I guess not. Anxiety and mental clutter feel toned down, and I feel like I have some control over my mood swings now. I guess this is more like having normal health than a nootropic but I just wanted to share my experience.

Edit: The brand is [Jarrow](https://www.jarrow.com/product/661/Methyl_B-12_&amp;_Methyl_Folate_Lemon) , all 3 in one lozenge, taste really good so I usually use 2.

Edit2: So its been a month and I said I would update. I did stop taking it everyday and take it only on occasion, B12 gives me lowkey anxiety which makes me have shortness of breath. Maybe if the dose woulnt be thousands of percent, who knows. Recently I bought some niacin to see if it would help, but im still experimenting with it and a few other things and cant really draw a conclusion. I will try update in another month or 2.",2019-07-28 20:04:18

TLR (True Life Research) Product Testing Results,199,2xf8z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2xf8z7/tlr_true_life_research_product_testing_results/,140,1425119498.0,"As some of you may know, TLR has been selling proprietary compounds and extracts since they launched. That led a lot of people, including myself, to call them out on the practice. Who in their right mind would take something that they did not know the ingredients or chemical structure of?!? We also questioned their testing practices, which led to the owner telling customers that they did not need testing, and that people should just trust them. Again, more red flags. Then we had the owner threatening to sue us moderators for slander, libel, and defamation. There are other crazy things that people have made me aware of via private message. However, we will not get into that at the moment. Needless to say, I have been interested in testing their products for a while, and have been organizing to do just that. Today, we have those results.

Again, a big thanks to Nootropics Depot, for use of their lab in this testing.

Let's start with the most alarming results. Four of TLR's ""proprietary"" compounds have tested as Taurine powder. That's right, TLR has been selling ADJ01, MORP-OX, HDAC-OX, and ADDX-OX as proprietary compounds, yet they are just Taurine powder! They are touting their ADDX-OX as ""Scientifically Engineered Proprietary Optimized Extract Formulation Acting Upon Resetting Addiction Targeted Pathways and Counteracting Hyper-Psychoneurodysfunctional States."" They are selling at-risk people with addiction, Taurine, yet telling them it will help them with with their addictions. This is flat out unacceptable! The ADDX-OX is selling for $140 for 24 capsules. They are selling 50 cents worth of Taurine for $140! I've spoken to one of their customers that is dealing with addiction, and bought that from them thinking it would help. After it doing nothing at all for him, he wrote me wondering if it was BS. Well now we know for sure it is.

Their MORP-OX is listed as ""a first-in-class herbal Mu Opioid Receptor (MOR) Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) Optimized Xtract."" It's a first class capsule of bullshit, is what it is. It's just Taurine in a capsule.

Their HDAC-OX is listed as a ""Scientifically Engineered HDAC Class I Inhibitor (HDAC-C1I) Extract."" NOPE, just Chuck Taurine.

Here are the percentages for each of those:

ADDX-OX- 94.79% match to Taurine

ADJ01- 99.16% match to Taurine

MORP-OX- 98.44% match to Taurine

HDAC-OX- 98.47% match to Taurine

____________________

Now we move onto the other results. These are more what I expected, rather than just Taurine capsules. A few of their other ""proprietary"" compounds and extracts came out to be normal things like Maca and Noopept.

Their ADJG2 is a 99.04% match to Noopept. It's not on the site now, but has been sent to a few people.

Their ADJB1 is a 96.58% match to Maca root powder. A customer that got ADJ01 from TLR actually asked the owner if it was just Maca root, since that is what it seemed like. The owner denied it, saying it was a totally different proprietary extract. Riiiight.

The HCBT-OX is likely Shilajit. Shilajit is not in the reference library, though. So we will need to do more testing on it to know for sure. It is an organic compound, somewhat related to Ashwagandha and Holy Basil. However, the physical characteristics match Shilajit. It's like little chunks of tar. I have no idea how we would expect people to use it properly.

There are a few other unreleased compounds that he was selling to customers who asked. ON-1 was an 85% match to ashwgandha, with distinctive peaks in the mid-high wavelengths. OB-1 was a 92.27% match to Niacin. It looks to be a mixture of things, with mostly Niacin in it. The other proprietary things we tested did not match anything in the reference library. So perhaps some of them are real. We will have to do some more testing to know.

Now for some good news. Some of the things they were selling as real compounds, actually were real.

Coluracetam was a 99.11% match to our reference sample.

Fasoracetam was a 98.54% match to our reference sample.

NSI-189 Freebase was a 99.10% match to our reference sample.

Memantine HCL was a 97.45% match to our reference sample.

So it appears that at least some of the non-proprietary compounds are what they are supposed to be. Some of the proprietary ones are things like Noopept, Maca, and Shilajit. Some are not in the reference library. Then some are just Taurine. Keep in mind that we have not tested every one of their products, since they have a metric shitload of them. We tested ones people were complaining about. If anyone else has any suspect TLR stuff, they can send it to me for further testing. We can also pay for further in-depth testing of any compounds that did not show up in our reference library, if people feel that is warranted. On that same token, if someone is willing to gather samples, and send them off to a third party lab, I am willing to pay for further testing. That will eliminate any claims of bias that might be made. I just did this testing round to get an idea of what we were dealing with.

IDRA-21 and weed is literally a living hell - BEWARE!,195,711vrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/711vrm/idra21_and_weed_is_literally_a_living_hell_beware/,69,1505843016.0,"Hello everyone. This is my first post here, sorry for my bad english, not my mother tongue. I am generally a lurker here and don't post anything, but I thought I needed to write something after what happened to me last night, I hope to help out and eventually even save someone else from this terrible mistake. I am still in shock. Keep in mind this experience happened around 12 hours ago.

Some time ago I ordered 500mg IDRA-21, but still hadn't tried it. Yesterday I decide to finally do it, after receiving my new precision scale. 

I weigh out exactly 5 milligrams of IDRA-21 and take it at around 2:45 P.M., after lunch. I feel absolutely nothing for a few hours, then I started noticing the effects. 

I was more focused, everything was *sharper*. I really don't known how to explain the effect properly, let's just say that I tend to perceive the world as more *dynamic* when sober, kinda hard to focus, my mind wanders around a lot, I often get distracted and drawn in my own thoughts. With IDRA, everything was more *static*, I perceived the surroundings as if they were under my control, as if everything was under my control. It was a real nice feeling overall, with just 5 mg! So went off to work and had an amazing session, no distractions, just got stuff done.

Time passed, I had dinner at approx. 8:30 P.M., then back to my house. I could still feel the IDRA, the half-life is around 48 hours from the reports available online, so that was normal. 

Then I had the fucked up idea: smoke a joint. I thought about possible interactions with the IDRA, so I researched online, but found **nothing** (main reason why I'm writing this now). I also had read that IDRA could cause terrible anxiety in some people, but that didn't happen to me. I thought that THC is a notorious anxiety-causing compound, so that may had been a shit idea, but I decided to do it nonetheless because THC never caused anxiety with me in any case. Only had I known what was coming...

I rolled up a super-light joint (0.4 g of weed), put on some music and started smoking. Finished the joint, everything seemed normal, the usual high. I was walking around my house with headphones and music, which I particularly enjoy when high. 

At a certain moment I noticed that the high was unusually more strong, so I put off the headphones and sat down. I noticed I was spacing out quite a bit, so I tried to stay calm by talking to myself. It worked, for the first 10 minutes lol. 

The high became increasingly stronger, it didn't even feel like weed anymore. I was completely dissociated, I had control over my body but the mind was elsewhere. Reality crumbled on itself as I was panicking. I wasn't able to tell what was real or not anymore, a new definition of fear, never experienced something like this in my life. Really a bad *fucking* trip.

The whole thing was accompanied by a strong tachycardia; I dropped on the bed and tried to stay calm. At a certain moment I was 100% positive I'd be dead in seconds.
The next two hours were a living nightmare, I would space out and then regain a bit of control over myself, then zone out again. 

Finally, it stopped very gradually. I drank water and went to sleep. Now, I got up ten minutes ago and I'm writing this report. As of now, I still feel something strange and not right. Could be that I'm still in shock, I really hope this goes away entirely. The IDRA should be out completely in about 24 hours, so I'll just chill at home today and hope for the best.

My guess is that IDRA-21, being an ampakine, which stimulates AMPA receptors, had some interaction with THC, that should impair these receptors. This enhanced the high to an unexpected point, where bad anxiety kicked in.

I hope this will help out someone eventually, or prevent someone else doing the same mistake. Thanks for your attention people, and stay safe! NEVER mix stuff up, unless you're sure that the stack works properly!

----------

EDIT #1 (15hrs after): Feeling better, still a bit shocked and feeling strange but it's definitely going away. It's interesting because I still feel the stimulation from the IDRA, so I am very focused, lol.

EDIT #2 (42hrs after): Better than yesterday, I'd say I'm back to normal. Had some trouble sleeping last night, woke up multiple times (never happens to me usually) and sleep quality was pretty bad. Can't say if I still feel the IDRA, probably got used to the stimulation by now. Will update if I crash after > 48 hours.",2017-09-19 23:13:36

Since i suffer from really nasty gabaergic kindling, i react to pretty much the tiniest downregulation of gaba (Ashwagandha is a gabaergic, source below, so it kind of baffled me when i read that it was 100% withdrawal free). So yesterday i took an ashwagandha dose that is equivalent to about 110mg of withanolides, and guess what, i got a pretty nasty rebound.

I know this is probably completely irrelevant to the majority of people since the effect of common doses won't be enough to cause noticeable rebounds for them, but for people who are very sensitive or maybe take very large doses over an extended period of time this might actually matter. Just thought i needed to get this out there since everyone seems to think that ash is completely devoid of any sort of withdrawal, which apparently is simply not true.

Virtual EMDR Therapy Has Been My Most Powerful Nootropic.

I medicate daily, eat a strict diet, work out, and I take 10 different nootropics/supplements on a daily basis to be at my peak performance.

But EMDR therapy has been the most powerful cognitive enhancer I have ever experienced.

Basically, EMDR works by 'blurring' disturbing memories so you can process them, and once doing so these memories no longer affect your consciousness. It does this through bi-lateral stimulation, and is said to affect your eye movements mimicking REM sleep, the brains natural recovery process. Some therapists wave a wand, use a light bar, tap on your knees, or use hand vibrators or sounds. Basically, anything to cause your eyes to move from left to right, or in circles.

The department of veterans affairs considers this the go-to therapy for veterans dealing with PTSD. https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/therapy-med/emdr-for-ptsd.asp

I found this interesting and wanted to try for my PTSD and found a trained therapist and completed my therapy 100% cured of my PTSD. The traumatic event I experienced no longer affected my conscious or subconscious mind. Whenever I thought back to the memory, it seemed to become further and further away. I found myself no longer 'jumpy' or agitated. 

But then, I thought it might be something that could help increase productivity and motivation. After being in therapy I felt ready to do EMDR by myself at home using youtube vidoes (and later virtualemdr.com and emdrtool.org). By 'blurring' all of the memories of my past laziness, depression, and low self esteem, I wanted to see if I could change my thinking patterns. I have found that humans are always drawn to the negatives. I wanted to see if I could 'blur' the negatives and let the positives shine through, lifting my mood and motivation.

And it worked! 

I am more productive than ever, more motivated than ever, and I haven't had a 'down' day in months. As this went on, I found myself continually becoming happier and more productive as I became happier and more productive. I was able to build off of this and form better relationships, succeed more at work, and overcome my self esteem issues and feelings of being unmotivated.

I do not believe EMDR is placebo as I went in 100% skeptical and did not expect it to work. While some say it doesn't work for them, it works very well for many people. Here are some studies on EMDR: https://emdrtool.org/studies http://www.emdr.com/research-overview/

**How to start EMDR**

1. Find a trained therapist. You can do this through Psychology today and select 'emdr' in the side bar. Unlike regular therapy it won't cost much, as you may only need a month or so of sessions.

2. Do it yourself with tools like https://virtualemdr.com and https://emdrtool.org - At first I tried virtualemdr.com and it was great. The price was a bit high but there was some good information. I started EMDR tool just a few days ago and its free and has the same information and even the same tool. But if you need coaching virtual emdr is probably the best option

3. Use 'leg tapping' or find a youtube video. There are plenty of free youtube videos about EMDR and free EMDR tools. There are also videos that use sounds if you don't like moving dots.

But no matter how you do EMDR it is definetly worth trying. Just make sure to educate yourself on how to find target memories. But seriously, everyone should at least give it a shot.",2018-08-20 06:40:07

Joe Cohen of SelfHacked is the Biohacking Community's Finest Plagiarizer and Conman (Bombshell Evidence),190,9hax7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9hax7q/joe_cohen_of_selfhacked_is_the_biohacking/,92,1537434564.0,"MORE PROOF OF PLAGIARISM FOUND 9/20 (Archive of HR software link)

Screenshots of evidence will be posted at the end of this post.

Joe Cohen had posted a link to take an interview to join his company. In the beginning, there is text about how nobody can pass his tests and if you do you will have the opportunity to join his company which of course, as stated in the text, everybody loves. As I go along the interview everything seems fine until I run across questions that are blatantly ripped off from a standardized testing body. I googled the questions and lo and behold they are taken directly from the LSAT sample questions on their website yet another red flag. Clearly, he needs better writers if they can’t even come up with their own original testing material. I continue the interview only to find out that they are in need of not only writers and editors, but developers as well. Embedded right into SelfHacked's HR software is a Cambridge Brain Sciences game that I am familiar with. I did some more digging into Joe Cohen and found his Facebook page which states that his HR software is revolutionary and going to change how hiring is done. At this point, I think it would be in his best interest to first reach out to Cambridge Brain Sciences to see if they want to get in on his very own revolutionary software. He mentions in his Facebook post that there is “little possibility for racism or sexism” however, he doesn’t mention there is a high opportunity for plagiarism all throughout his genius software. Be wary of anything involved with this company and its owner, many others in the previous thread mentioned that he’s full of crap but this only confirms that and more.

My post and screenshot evidence from the other thread:

I took your interview, do Cambridge Brain Sciences and the Law School Admission Council know that you are stealing their property with the intentions of making money off of it? I did some more digging and found your Facebook page where you state that your HR software is revolutionary and that you plan on commercializing it soon, I can only assume that this link is what you are talking about when you speak of your HR software. I've attached screenshots of ""your"" HR software and a screenshot of the Cambridge Brain Sciences game to show people that you are blatantly stealing and taking advantage of other people's hard work, just like this ""token of appreciation"" to scour your sites for hours to maybe get 10 dollars.

This is content stolen directly from the Law School Admission Council...

Here is the page it is ripped off from, if anybody has a copy of the LSAT Super Prep book from the Law School Admissions Council with the test from 1996 they can confirm this for themselves:  ISBN-13: 978-0-9793050-6-1  ISBN-10: 0-9793050-6-3  are the ISBN numbers for the book it's from. Notice how Joe Cohen changed ""coordinator of an exhibition"" to ""carpet store owner"" and then changed ""rugs"" to ""carpets"" but literally everything else is identical, what a coincidence!

Curcumin-free turmeric exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities: Identification of novel components of turmeric.

Aggarwal BB1, Yuan W, Li S, Gupta SC.


Abstract

Turmeric, a dried powder derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been used for centuries in certain parts of the world and has been linked to numerous biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antigrowth, anti-arthritic, anti-atherosclerotic, antidepressant, anti-aging, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, wound healing, and memory-enhancing activities. One component of turmeric is curcumin, which has been extensively studied, as indicated by more than 5600 citations, most of which have appeared within the past decade. Recent research has identified numerous chemical entities from turmeric other than curcumin. It is unclear whether all of the activities ascribed to turmeric are due to curcumin or whether other compounds in turmeric can manifest these activities uniquely, additively, or synergistically with curcumin. However, studies have indicated that turmeric oil, present in turmeric, can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin. **Studies over the past decade have indicated that curcumin-free turmeric (CFT) components possess numerous biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic activities.** Elemene derived from turmeric is approved in China for the treatment of cancer. The current review focuses on the anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities exhibited by CFT and by **some individual components of turmeric, including turmerin, turmerone, elemene, furanodiene, curdione, bisacurone, cyclocurcumin, calebin A, and germacrone.**",2018-06-20 06:31:11

Nootropics legality: It’s has been getting harder…,188,8ghi12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8ghi12/nootropics_legality_its_has_been_getting_harder/,155,1525297450.0,"I made a short list of facts below to describe what has been happening to the nootropic industry/market/community:

All has happened over the last 3-4 years.

1. Amazon prohibited selling nootropics. It happened about 4 years ago. Before that one could buy even Phenibut and even in Germany. (Disclaimer: I personally did it without any problems)
2. PayPal and other payment processors froze all accounts of nootropic vendors and declined to work with them. Happened almost three years ago. (Disclaimer: several of accounts have been shut down and money released after 180 days)
3. Reviews on Ceretropic and products descriptions had to be deleted. (I liked reading them and it was sad that they were not available anymore)
4. UK nootropic ban: it’s became illegal to sell even noopept there. (Some websites like nootropics.co.uk were gone)
5. Australia declared Phenibut illegal. (recently) But this was more or less justified because on FB too many ppl abuse it.
6. Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase declined to work with nootropic vendors and deleted wallets of people who bought nootropics using their platforms. (2 or 3 years ago)
7. Reddit deleted many communities/posts and changed the rules on different subreddits including r/nootropics. (2-3 weeks ago)
8. A large vendor Powdercity was shut down because of a Tianeptine overdose by an adolescent. 
9. FDA raided another vendor - Awakebrain and it was shut down.
10. Youtube deleted videos of popular nootropic video bloggers. ( just 2 days ago)

This all means that it is extremely hard if not impossible to sell and to market nootropic supplements. They only can be sold “not for human consumption and without any warnings because warnings could imply actual human consumption”. 

My suggestion is that if we are to survive we need to show in a convincing, consistent and public manner thousands of people who clearly benefited from nootropics after they tried FDA-approved drugs. I know among my customers a few people who tell me this and I am sure all most of the vendors can say the same. We are not selling dangerous substances that are regularly abused by people who can’t control themselves. That is not correct.

There is definitely a free area between strong but FDA-approved drugs and lesser effective nootropics/anxiolytics approved in other countries. 

Anyway, just my thoughts on this. Feel free to comment or criticise.

And I know this sub is kinda dead ever since the good old days of experimental noots, but this is kinda a story of a currently available experimental noot (given it isn’t just uridine monophosphate, but instead, a fairly novel relative of such), and I hope you all will take time to read, and enjoy it.

That being evenly shared,

**I never thought I’d quit smoking.**

In fact, **I made peace with it.**

I was ruining my lungs and I was having so much trouble breathing. *I had tried everything.*

Or ... so I thought. Until I met TAU.


Story:

I worked at a local natural food store, in the vitamin department...

(being a nootnerd from the good experimental and well-informed r/nootropics days of 2016-2017, this was ideal - I gave suuuuuch good advice and learned sooooo much from so many different types of people - the most useful of which were native islanders, given they are eons ahead of the FDA, in terms of their successful utilization of plant medicine, and medicine in general, for restoring people to good health, from countless disorders/diseases; I would have 2 hr communications with them, and my boss only encouraged it, in that I may learn and gain a good customer who trusts us, as well)

..and I had this..issue, of only one smoke break, and, two...if I ate a fast lunch, lending me time to smoke, which always ended up going on longer than I was told to have lunch... 

and I was on Reddit/nootropics one day, during the end of the good old shining days, about 6 months to a year after the time Ceretropic shut down. I learned from many posts, about uridine and triacetyluridine - so many people talking about how it made their cigarettes much better satisfying, efficient, enjoyable (1 feeling like 3) to the point of putting them out faster, and having that satiation last longer, something that actually works without having something making the cigarette less enjoyable (like Chantix, jeez the nightmares from that), or, something as a substitute that made me feel sick or just entirely different than cigs (like patches or lozenges).

I bought it.

I took 25mg (serving size) every morning.

The stories turned out being no fable. Absolutely accurate.

I could actually bear work with 1 smoking break.


It was absolutely a positive opportunity, a “step” to smoking *less*, at least.

Enter the unintended entirely unforeseen results:

I tried multiple e-juice and e-cig things before the salts came out. When I first tried this fairly new (at the time) wave of nicotine salts (instead of basic nicotine 1.9% e-juice, tried and failed many times, to the point of returning to smoking, before I tried salts), upon the first time I vaped just a basic little juul,

(really these are kind of the minimal satiation/delivery mechanism of nicotine, out of modern vaping devices, nowhere near the criticism they got, *if they just didn’t target kids, and instead targeted adults*, that is), 

I felt it. After just a few drags. I was satiated and I didn’t want any more. I thought “why would I need cigs when this leaves me feeling fine without the sickness factor? When I smoked SO much, before... how could this be possible?

I remembered the TAU.

I tried days without the TAU. Nothing similar. Vapes left me wanting cigs, when in the absence of TAU. I immediately began supplementing TAU again. I was amazed. I still am, tbh. 1.5 years cigarette-free, and healthy af. In fact after 3 days of no smoking, people came up to me at work and made comments about my skin, asking what I did, commenting that I appeared shiny, smooth, clear, healthy. I replied “iiiiii dunno? I just quit smoking though, maybe that’s—“ they interrupted “THATS IT! yo, you look amazing, good job!”

I was like... damn, Daniel. I didn’t even have to try, and this just kinda happened by accident (well, research and experimentation).

*It is reliable, consistent*. The combination of nicotine salts and triacetyluridine...  i never intended upon entirely quitting smoking...

(1 x 25mg, daily, every morning, which I have taken for years now), 

...actually made me unintentionally quit smoking. Meaning, no challenge, whatsoever. And I don’t even Vape much at all.

 (I actually initially got the juul in order of harnessing my habit while being unable to leave the store for multiple smoke breaks, it had nothing to do with quitting smoking, by any means!)

...and I was shocked.


So, I eventually got an SO, who worked in the store. He had trouble quitting smoking. He would go back, forth, between cigs and vapes, a very unhealthy pair for a very unhealthy predicament for the lungs...

(having all those 599 cig chemicals with which we lace cigs, in this world, covered in a light sheath of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine, from nicotine salts, is a very bad combo for the lungs, without an expectorant or something to promote fresh mucous release, cleaning the mucosa/membranes from which mucous comes, in the lungs)

...and I ultimately got him to begin trying triacetyluridine. He then actually quit smoking cigarettes altogether, by day three, and he began only utilizing an e-cig, on sparse occasion.


I was shocked. “Am I really onto something, that can at least get people out of the trap of inhaling CO daily, as well as abating the harmful exposure all the harmful hundreds of chemicals put in tobacco cigarettes?” I thought to myself....


Recently, I helped someone get off opioids entirely, when his previous OD-ing on random days, was rather troubling for my psychologist, who knew I had the solution (kratom) and was familiar with the scientific basis for it being a better secure and free-from-danger/harm/OD-ing that comes with pharma and street opioids (based off the opium poppy, and it’s many opioid constituents). So she asked if I would help him. Instantly I agreed, and he began to live with me, which he did for the most recent couple months, since mid-to-early January, 2020, until mid/early march, 2020. I got him free from opioids (kratom replacement therapy, in actual responsible amounts, with no extract, THC (CBD replacement therapy), 

And

Ultimately, with the help of **triacetyluridine**

(He was also smoking as well as utilizing e-cigs, this dangerous predicament I spoke of earlier in this post)

He got to the point of actually adjusting... (rather rapidly, my third case now, out of three attempted, including myself and my SO who I met when I worked at the natural food store)  

...quitting cigs permanently, sticking with vaping alone, here and there, with daily triacetyluridine taken, altogether freeing himself from the multiple-chemical toxicity of popular (almost all) cigarettes which are adulterated with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals, while combustion (carbon monoxide) therefore was also abated. 

Actually throwing his cigs out. He had a pack of “natural” American spirits, and, lucky strikes. He tossed them out one day, without even mentioning it. I saw them in the trash. I was like DUDE! AWESOME! You’re killin it!



I can’t vouch enough for triacetyluridine. I never thought I’d quit smoking actual cigarettes, let alone, help two others do the same, without the slightest of difficulty. 

Anyway, I’m sorry this was so long, but ... it’s worth giving the story. 

I can’t vouch for regular uridine, given I only tried triacetyluridine, and if it works, it works, and I’m a happy panda (as well as those I’ve gotten to quit their cig, or cig + vape combo, habits).

I acknowledge that vaping is addictive, but tbh cigs are way greater addictive and they have hundreds, if not thousands, of reasons which thoroughly rationalize why they are simply much worse than vaping. Mainly re: the Carbon Monoxide, and, the [chemical additives in cigarettes.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_in_cigarettes). Also, note: the “vaping epidemic” was due to thc cartridges, mainly black market ones with vitamin E acetate in them. Nicotine e-juice vaping has nothing to do with that whole debacle. And I strongly discourage the usage of thc oil pens, for this reason. Especially black market ones (albeit it’s been proven that even the credible cartridges from medical stores/dispensaries, have had issues when overheated, by pressing the button on e-Vape-pens that heats the element, causing an unintended release of a ton of initially unforeseen carcinogenic compounds, prior testing after the “vaping epidemic” was announced).

But it just is ... bottom line, wonderful, for all three of us to be able to easily breathe again. I am no longer smelly, I can run miles again, and I wouldn’t have been able to do it without TAU (triacetyluridine) - noting that, yes, I did take tau out at one point, and the nicotine vaping wasn’t enough - I craved cigarettes so much, just like my friends who were alternating between vaping and cigs by the hour, every day, and they now no longer have that issue, having TAU 25mg every morning.

I just couldn’t be greater thankful to the nootropics wellness community, for making this chem accessible to the public. I also now pair it with a *high quality* form of Fish Oil, given the learned research of nootropic benefit with the two (TAU and fish oil) combined, and I couldn’t be happier.

(Also just recently added 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and, safe to add: without it, I wouldn’t have made this post; works very quickly, albeit maybe I am just sensitive to BDNF regulation, from the good old days of Ceretropic’s peptides)

Thank you, u/misteryouaresodumb, for unknowingly (until now) having helped me quit my cigarette habit, as well as two other people. We now can breathe lightly when we are awake and asleep, something we all never had the opportunity of experiencing until these days. I can run miles! I couldn’t run a block, when I smoked cigs!!!

It's been debilitating to say the very least. The depression creeped in at 15 and has lingered ever since. Depersonalized much later.

I noticed when I first started drinking that during an EPIC hangover, all three symptoms go away and finally, clarity sets in. My mind opens up. The same with all the individuals i'm in contact with. It's like the elixir for all our problems. 

As the night progresses, I regress into my old self. The inattentiveness, blocked thoughts, depression. We're on a hunt to find out what's going on but It's been a long time and we haven't gotten very far.

A few things worth noting:
I don't get sick, regardless of how much I drink (could be a clue). The more the better. 

Have tried everything from NADH, all the activated B's, b12/folate, Tianeptine, Noopept, D-Aspartic Acid, Aniracetam, Phenibut, Pregnenolone + an array of vitamins, supplements and noots. Nothings worked except Sarcosine which has helped very subtly. 

Nicotine and Amphetamine make me dysphoric. Stims hardly help. I'm assuming I have high acetylcholine. 

Another awesome thing that props up is my drive to be social during the hangover. I become a lot more extroverted and dis-inhibited. I become interested in having long conversations/connecting with people which is unlike my usual self. I become a lot more emotional too.

I think it could be a disruption in VTA signalling but what's causing it? Ghrelin? Insulin Resistance (had a test, everything seems fine)? Growth Hormone dysfunction?

Literally at a loss. Can't live like this.

2. Take care of yourself and pay close attention.

I recently found out that a friend of mine, who I recommended Bacopa Monnieri (BaCognize) to for memory issues, has been extremely depressed, lethargic, and demotivated. So much so, that they decided to go see a doctor who then prescribed them an anti-depressant. I am not completely sure what SSRI they were prescribed. However, it does not matter. Covering up negative symptoms with another supplement is never a good idea. When I recommended Bacopa, I made sure to send them the beginner's guide, as well as, articles discussing the effects of Bacopa. I suggested paying close attention to any and all changes in sleep, mood, cognitive function, energy levels., etc. Even though I did this, the person still lacked the awareness and discipline to take on the responsibility to take this nootropic. I am so glad that I caught up with this person because they started taking Bacopa over 8 months ago. 4 months after that, they began taking the SSRI with no improvement. That is ridiculous to me. 

And that is why I write this post today. When taking nootropics, you are taking on the responsibility of managing your own health. Unless you are consulting a physician, which I doubt the majority of us are, you should be taking this responsibility seriously. A lot of the posts on here are anecdotal. If you do not have a good sense of yourself; good sleeping and eating patterns, self-awareness, self-control over emotions, fully developed brain, etc. you should be extremely cautious. A boost in memory or verbal fluidity isn't worth total anhedonia or any other possible negative effects you may experience. I see people in the comment sections of some posts that are very short sided when recommending nootropics or answering questions about nootropics. For those who are newer to r/Nootropics, please take the time to understand, in its entirety, the nootropics you are consuming before consuming them. The [beginner's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/nootropics/wiki/beginners) is always a helpful tool to read before getting lost down the rabbit holes.

Many of the aforementioned nootropics particularly the racetams and ashwagandha caused sleep interruptions almost every time I took them so I had to ditch them.

Removing senescent cells stimulates new tissue production.

Senescent cells are cells that have stopped dividing and secrete toxic chemicals that damage adjacent cells. Accumulation of senescent cells, which increases with age, is associated with chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, most cancers, dementia, arthritis, osteoporosis, and frailty. 

Jan van Deursen, the researcher mentioned in the article is the co-founder of [Unity Biotechnology](https://unitybiotechnology.com/) (private/Arch Ventures) which has several senolytics in the pre-clinical stage. 

In early 2015, the team identified the first senolytics: an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug, dasatinib, which eliminates human fat-cell progenitors that have turned senescent; and a plant-derived health-food supplement, quercetin, which targets senescent human endothelial cells, among other cell types. The combination of the two — which work better together than apart — alleviates a range of age-related disorders in mice.

14 senolytics have been described in the literature, including small molecules, antibodies and, in March this year, a peptide that activates a cell-death pathway and can restore lustrous hair and physical fitness to aging mice.

Two natural compounds - quercetin and tocotrienols, an isoform of Vitamin E, are modest senolytics. ",2017-10-27 04:02:47

I’ve tried all the recommendations from this community and others, to gain minor improvements in my daily functioning life. 

I’ve had access to an isolated delta 9 thc distillate (not sure if this is the right terminology) for a while, but haven’t really done anything with it. A couple weeks ago I decided to dilute a gram of the thc into some mct oil and bottled it into a tincture bottle. I have the doses measured to 6mg thc per .25ml tincture. 

My experience with doses around 5mg has been life changing. There is no psychoactive effect at this dose. Rather, I experience a gentle sense of calm focus. It feels like my brain is finally working the way it’s supposed to. All of the negative symptoms of adderall are gone. I haven’t noticed any diminishing effects over time either. I’ve kept the dose right around 5mg in the morning, and another 5mg at the end of my work day. This has been more effective than any other supplement I’ve tried in the past. 

There isn’t a lot of information out there from what I can tell. I saw a post on here with a few studies that show low dose thc has a positive effect on repairing memory, and some cardiovascular benefits. 

I would love to hear from anybody who has experience supplementing low dose thc. Have you had similar results? Is it an effective nootropic for those without ADD? I always take these doses along side my rx. I wonder if there a synergy happening between the two, or if low dose thc can stand on its own as a powerful nootropic?",2019-09-06 05:09:58

Sedentary Lifestyle? Don't look for a supplement solution!

I recently just got back in the gym and feel better than ever. No Nootropic supplement can compare to how great I feel. Feeling down? Gym. Feeling sluggish? Gym. Brain fog? Gym.  
Although Nootropics are extremely helpful, there is no magic pill that can compare to a healthy lifestyle. Why not fine-tune your system? We're meant to be in motion. We're meant to be social. Get away from the computer and go work out and meet someone. These are the best Nootropics.

"Meditation has completely ""cured"" me of my depression.",181,4y9mxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4y9mxm/meditation_has_completely_cured_me_of_my/,106,1471514483.0,"Hey guys. It's night time right now and I'm tired so I'm not going to do the long post I had planned. The energy from caffeine has run out lol.

So basically for the last 10 months or so I've experienced horrible depression. It was of the anhedonic variety. Maybe I'll go into depth later, but it was horrible. Suicide was often in the back of my mind.

These last two month's, after stalking some very inspiring posters on reddit, I myself was inspired to meditate. I had been mindful this last year but I wasn't putting the time in and wasn't sincerely meditating.

After a night of sleep deprivation induced anti-depressant relief, I became insanely mindful and started dutifully watching and observing my thoughts. I also started meditating for at least 5 minutes a day, but most often it was over 30 minutes, sometimes a couple of hours.

I still feel unpleasant sensations and pleasant sensations, but I simply don't care most of the time about them. In fact for the past week I've experienced varying amounts of anxiety. But it just doesn't matter. I've experienced and become more familiar with my thoughts, and realized that they're just sensations, just mental constructs, not ""me"". Pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice.

No fap has also helped. In fact, I relapsed on day 15-25, idk I forgot the date. It definitely hindered me. It's okay though. Just another thought in the wind. This past week I've waned in my time spent meditating. I am going to be mediating a lot more again.

My diet hasn't really changed, besides eating more calories again. No new nootropics really. In fact, some adaptogens I bought actually made me more depressed for a while.

At first my cognition seemed to suffer, but the longer I meditated the more enhanced and sharp I've become.

I still have a long way to go but I just thought I might inspire some people to at least check it out, start meditating.

Tomorrow I will write more in depth on my experiences, and possibly help some of you guys out if I (hopefully) can. I've noticed that some of the brightest and most frequent posters on this subreddit are depressed. You guys know who you are. I mean, jesus, it seems like everyone on this sub is depressed! Like 80% of people on this subreddit have depression. Drugs, diet, sleep, exercise, ect can help guys. But if you've lived your whole life with poor health, and the mental patterns poor health causes, then you have some work to do. Those mental patterns have been imprinted deep in your mind. Using semax to raise dopamine and serotonin and BDNF isn't going to ""cure"" you. It never ""cured"" me. No nootropic did. Those play a small role when your own mind is working against them. It's comforting to think you can buy happiness with nootropics, but in my experience and readings, you can't, and if you can, it's not sustainable, nor is it real happiness. I can't describe what real happiness is, but I've tasted it, and I know meditation is the path that leads to it. There's a reason no one you know has ever *really* seemed happy. It's because so little people are aware of the benefits meditation holds. So many people take their thoughts and feelings so seriously. None of that is you. ""You"" aren't even ""real"". There just *is*.

I would like to thank a few people on reddit for being an inspiration for my practice and helping me see the light (lol). Thank you so much. 

Edit: I want to give some background on my life so you can understand how my situation was.

Ever since my first memory, I distinctly recall dissatisfaction.

In 3rd grade, I became depressed. I often told my mom I was depressed. I think I even said I hated life, in 3rd grade. I would often cry and was an extremely sensitive kid. It was quite sad. 

In 10th grade I started experimenting with phenibut, vicodin, and tried adderall once.

In 11th grade of high school, I abused alcohol and diphenhydramine, the worst two drugs to abuse, and also drugs that don't really feel so good anyways. I had tried some low-quality ecstasy in 10th grade, half a pill, but that left me pretty depressed for a couple of days, and I feel as though it left a subtle mark in my psyche.

By the end of 11th grade, things were bad. I had hit the back of my head whilst drunk, hard, and probably gave myself a concussion. My parents caught me and my friends getting drunk that same night. When I awoke the next morning, I drank coffee on an empty stomach and had horrible heart pains, along with probable excitotoxicity. After that incident my mind was severely disturbed. Sometimes I would randomly see black lines or black dots, white dots, white lines. It's like my occipital lobe was miscalculaing what my eyes were sending it. I started having bad intrusive thoughts and OCD. Nihilism was also a theme of this time, which made me extremely depressed. I also at one point was so out of it that I thought that the CIA/other people could read my thoughts. Yeah, I know.

I had read Absolutus's thread on meditation. I at this point was still craving worldy things, and I thought perhaps meditation could turn me into Bradley Cooper on NZT. I started skipping lunch at school and meditating. I was able to talk my teacher into letting me meditate during class, in the closet, where it was quiet and dark. I meditated at least an hour a day for 3-6 months, I can't remember the exact dates. I distinctly remember reading how Absolutus cured his severe depression with meditation. I was hopeful but never really believed it possible. I know now it's possible. My experience of reality is proof.

I basically cured my major mental disorders. During the summer between 11th and 12th grade, I meditated semi-often and started using noopept. Before sleep, morning, whenever. That fucked my circadian rhythm up hard. 

In October of senior year I was hit by massive depression, anhedonic variety. I hated school. I was incredibly stressed by everything. I started using drugs again. I thought just having a Buddhist philosophy could save me. I was also still pretty goal-oriented, I wanted worldly things. I would often wish I would be killed, by anything. My mind was severely disturbed and distorted, it was delusional. I was becoming more empathetic however. I was basically anxious and depressed all day, experienced very little pleasure, and wanted to die. Towards the end of the year I used kratom in large doses daily, for about two months consistently. That didn't help things. I actually started feeling like shit from it and had to quit. Xanax and DXM and phenibut were also used towards the end of this year. Not good for me either. Xanax sent me into a depressive episode for one week straight. It was pretty bad. I cried a lot that week. Nothing made sense, it was all very confusing. ""I never asked to be born"" was a thought that appeared in my head often. ""Why must we suffer?!?"", ect.

However, after reading some inspiring posters post history (lol), I decided to fully commit myself, because the Buddha seemed to have had things figured out. Being extremely mindful, letting your thoughts appear and vanish, meditating for at least 10 minutes a day, preferably as much as possible, as well as being as ethical, empathetic, honest, and genuine as possible, treating my fellow conscious beings with love and care, imagining every person or animal or bug or small thing, as my mother, or me as their mother... Well, it's basically transformed my mental health. I don't really know what to say. My sexuality is morphing from pure lust, to a very gentle love with no sexual tones at all. I find it harder and harder to hate others. I'm not perfect, but I'm getting better and improving myself, improving my consciousness. I'm as vegetarian (No animals killed) as possible now, fuck the health detriments (I eat as well as possible for a mostly vegetarian diet, lots of milk.)

When I first got into nootropics, I thought it would turn me into an ubermensch. I was gonna use nootropics and hack my life, keep motivation and pleasure sky-high, have my mind be as sharp as a pin and operate like a super-computer. I wanted health and happiness, I wanted approval of others. I wanted fame. I wanted money. I wanted to be more attractive, more charming, more more more. At one point, when I was particularly lustfully ambitious, I wanted to rule the world. Now, my only desire is to see others be happy and healthy. My only desire is for myself to be happy and healthy.

I think a lot of you are wasting your precious time and effort and money on nootropics and research. I've spent above $1,000 while on supplements, and really they have little effect, compared to mediation. Most nootropics are band-aids. They don't help your health in the long-run. If your brain/cells thought it was a good idea to increase BDNF, it would have done so already. There's a reason you have low X or Z. It's not random. Focus on health, not ""increase dopamine/serotonin/BDNF/ect"". Unless you have an SNP that clearly shows an undesirable gene, then don't change it, try to improve health first. And one of the best ways of increasing health is mediation. We undergo so much stress just by living with our current mindsets. An unbelievable amount. We just aren't as aware of it anymore, because it's chronic, our whole lives. Just like how you aren't conscious of your shirt anymore. It's in the background. From being mindful, I've realized I've been processing life in an extremely stressful way. I bet many of you are the same as me in that regard. Did you know that people in a room with nothing to do, other than shock themselves, will shock themselves withe electricity? 63% of men, or around there, will shock themselves. Humans seem to be unable to cope without distraction. It's like something is gnawing away at the inside of us. It doesn't have to be that way. Just stop choosing distraction and start facing who you are, who you *really* are, not who you tell yourself you are. That, that is a delusion. Meditate, and you'll start to understand who you really are.

If you only research nootropics or health because you feel like you have to, in order to become superhuman, then you need to take a step back and analyze your life. For me personally, my research has become fun in-and-of-itself, so I do that in my free time, and one of my main motivators is enhancing the health of myself and others. If your only motivation is to become god, then stop.

And has anyone else noticed that so many people on this sub are so severely depressed?! I mean, it's only natural. The people who go on here either had problems they're trying to fix or they want to become a superhuman. 

I hope you are able to find something of value from my giant wall of text. I'm not thinking clearly right now but I think I said what was important for me to say. I just thought others might like to hear what I've learned from living. It's not all right but the parts that resonate with you should help you the most.

I am cured, and have never been happier in my entire life. I hope all of you can experience the same as I have. 

Strive diligently towards enlightenment and freedom.

Repeat these to yourself everyday: 

1. I am sure to become old; I cannot avoid ageing.
	
2. I am sure to become ill; I cannot avoid illness.	

3. I am sure to die; I cannot avoid death.	

4. I must be separated and parted from all that is dear and beloved to me.

5. I am the owner of my actions, heir of my actions, actions are the womb (from which I have sprung), actions are my relations, actions are my protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad, of these I shall become the heir.

And be ethical, empathetic, honest, disciplined, moral, and genuine. You will become happy, it's just a matter of time. Meditate. Breath and be calm. 

I hope you all the best in everything you do.

I guess I could consider this edit sort of a rambling rant, but I like it's stream-of-consciousness style. It also felt cathartic in a way, kinda. 

Edit 2: After you read my post, take what resonates with you and leave the rest. Then, start meditating and following the Dhamma. If you have any questions, the Buddhism and Meditation subs on Reddit are perfect for you.

And I want to be very clear. Meditating hasn't made me a ""superhuman"" either. I am not blissed out all day (and in my opinion, feeling euphoric all day isn't really what I want, or need). I am not super charming, I am not a genius. 

In fact, the pleasant and unpleasant sensations I feel are pretty similar to how I felt a couple of months ago. It's just that now, I feel them as objects, instead of me. It's like I've taken a step back. I still feel the raw sensation of pain or pleasure, but in either case it doesn't really have any emotional ""charge"" to it. 

And I still get caught up in emotions. Though I think the feeling of getting caught up is just more sensation. I am not a ""master"". 

I just am, and that's okay.",2016-08-18 15:31:23

Always just want to stay in bed, eat and watch youtube/twitch. tried a number of nootropics in the past such as Cdp choline, NAC, vitamin D, huperzine A, sulphorophane, l-theanine, glycine and some others. got a sleep tracker and got my sleeping routines in check. nothing helped much. Tried modafinil aswel. felt the wakefulness, nothing else tho.


Until last 2 weeks since i got waklert from the same seller that i had my modafinil in the past.

took 75mg for 4 days in these 2 weeks and its amazing. i get lost in doing productive work, both for university and for personal projects. it feels good to go out and walk, i dont feel like just going back to bed anymore. ive left the house more times than i did in 2 months probably. i also do better socially, strike up convos with people i just wouldnt feel the need or reason to talk to before.


aware might still be placebo but i realized it on my first day of taking, sometime in the evening, when i worked for like 6 hours on something i couldnt start working on for months. it just hit me right then when i realize how incredibly productive i was.


But armodafinil is too expensive for me too continuosly take it, im also afraid of tolerance and long term effects. 
it made me aware tho that there is something wrong with me that might be possible to fix.

so now im looking for answers:

1. why? what could be wrong with me for the past 2 yeras that armodafinil solves?

2. why armodafinil but not modafinil? ill take modafinil again tomorrow to make sure again that it doesnt have the same effect, but why? in what way are they different?",2020-01-15 04:25:32

Contrary to the typically-circulated ill effects of a hangover, some of us experience what we call the 'alcohol afterglow'. Here is a post from about a year back by u/bigjew222, who compiled a list of our anecdotes describing this effect: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8sfkkd/the\_big\_badass\_megacollection\_of\_alcohol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8sfkkd/the_big_badass_megacollection_of_alcohol/) 

In school, I recently learned about the role of glycine transporters, glutamate, and NMDA receptors in neurotransmission. While a lot of us tend to focus on dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine neurotransmission with supplement stacks and the like - the complexities of glutamate and GABA seem to be undermined at times. When I studied compounds like sarcosine (N-methylglycine; a selective glycine transporter blocker) and saw their therapeutic implications in depressive symptoms and negative symptoms in Schizophrenia - I saw that the glycine transport blocking affinity is similar to what alcohol accomplishes. Alcohol is weaker and less selective but accomplishes the effects in a dose-dependent fashion. 

Due to the relief from social anxiety, verbal fluency, and social confidence users described after a night of drinking, I am fairly certain one of the major contributors to the 'afterglow' portion of the hangover is partially due to blocking of glycine transporters (GLYTs). Now, what this says about people who get the afterglow and those that do not - I am not sure. It is indeed an effect I experience after combining a night of drinking with a positive social experience.",2019-11-19 13:19:00

I’ve started diaphragmatic breathing lately and the immediate effects on anxiety/relaxation have been comparable to low dose xanax, and I’m not very susceptible to the placebo effect, especially for things which aren’t drugs. 
 
Give it a try right now. Make sure you breathe with your belly/diaphragm. There should be no movement in your rib cage/chest/shoulders. Place a hand on your chest to make sure.

If you can’t figure it out right away don’t worry, it can take a few attempts. Lying on your back can make it a lot easier when you’re getting started. There’s also plenty of YouTube videos with better instructions.

Don't forget to check your diet before you dump money into supplements. Zinc changed my life!!,178,85cbv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/85cbv1/dont_forget_to_check_your_diet_before_you_dump/,82,1521419861.0,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION

------

I've struggled with eating food due to my medications (stimulants).  Because of this, I have suffered from nutritional deficits.  

I was feeling really depressed and had almost no self esteem for a few weeks; life was difficult and it only made my appetite even worse.  I tried a few supplements like Boron and Ginkgo.  And although I felt a difference in my motivation and sex drive, it didn't give me the confidence I knew I was missing.

I started taking Zinc recently.  Ho-ly-shit.  This is a game changer.  Immediate effects - huge boost of confidence, sex drive at a normal level, boners that could kill, and determination and focus like you wouldn't believe. 

Try it if you aren't eating enough food and you have some of the same symptoms I had.  Just make sure you take it on a full stomach.  

------

DOSAGE AND TYPE

* Zinc Gluconate, 50 mg.
* 2-3x a day with a full meal.  I take it with a high protein and fat diet.  
* I haven't settled on the dosage yet - I'm just going by how I feel and whether or not I feel like I'm on my ""game"". 

You can buy this at most supermarkets.  I'm not going to endorse any brands.

SIDE EFFECTS

* Confidence
* Increased libido
* Determination and focus
* No ""brain fog""
* Stronger body odor",2018-03-19 06:07:41
Lions Mane is a godsend,173,buespg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/buespg/lions_mane_is_a_godsend/,157,1559165941.0,"Hello /r/nootropics!

&#x200B;

For the last couple of months, I've been trying to get back to reality and to my old self after going through psychosis. I was put on Lithium which helped tremendously, but then started to give me really strange side effects (tremors, RLS, neck twitching, migraines), so I had to stop. I recently started using Lions Mane for the first time, and it has been acting really good on me.

I feel slightly stimulated, everything has a 'flow', minimized anxiety, and what's most awesome is that I'm starting to feel like my old self, capable of reasoning about problems. It feels like it activated my problem-solving gears and I've been coding all day, loving it. It's however concerning that I'm not able to access/not as sharp as I was before. I guess this takes time. I'm trying to battle 'should-this-take-time' vs 'should-i-get-a-supplement-that-boosts-this-progress'.

&#x200B;

Lithium and Lion's mane both induce NGF, and I'm thinking about getting back on it. Unfortunately Lithium blocks me being able to microdose, something I might have to live with and give up for a good amount of time. Maybe good reason to not do any drugs whatsoever, since it does not play well with any serotonegic substances.

&#x200B;

Depression is fucked up and annoying when you know you're ready but your system isn't -- hopefully these effects can be achieved long-term and that I'm able to use this supplement as a 'cycle' and not for temporary boost use like all the racetams, choline and most nootropics.

This is one of the few places where you could post a peer-reviewed study pertaining to cognition, and have an interesting discussion about it.

The moderators are all knowledgeable and contribute toward the discussion.


I honestly don't have much bad to say about it, especially recently. I did once complain that it seemed that it was starting feel more like popular reddit rather than /r/nootropics. 

I'm mainly making this thread as a rebuttal to the ""What's wrong with this sub"". The poster was a real asshole who never contributes here, acted like he owned the place, addressed people (even bill...) as 'yo' and 'dude' and didn't propose any solutions other than vague ambiguities for what I see as a non-existent problem (which was pretty much that there is not a 'consensus' on these things, dude).

I personally believe /r/nootropics is the single best subreddit on reddit. If you have anything positive to state about this sub, be sure to do so!",2014-09-18 22:28:06
Caffeine can decrease subjective energy depending on the vehicle with which it is consumed and when it is measured,173,e6n19w,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Caffeine-can-decrease-subjective-energy-depending-Young-Benton/da7cf298291acf7817c2025f5fb74ccbcb9b3c0a,59,1575606392.0,,2019-12-06 09:56:32
What L-theanine does in the body,178,dz8frn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dz8frn/what_ltheanine_does_in_the_body/,40,1574313600.0,"Regarding the following research paper: 

[https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/142/12/2091/4630725](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/142/12/2091/4630725) 

I gather the following:

\- L-theanine is absorbed quite quickly by nearly everyone, the maximum plasma concentration of L-theanine is generally reached 0.8 hours after ingestion.

\- L-theanine is very likely hydrolized to glutamate and ethylamine

\- Following 100 mg L-theanine ingestion (575 µM L-theanine, of which about 70 % gets into plasma, will be metabolized into about 400 µM ethylamine), the time to reach the highest concentration of ethylamine is dependent on individual physiology. The longest time in the paper is about 14 hours. So 500 mgs at 10 PM means max ethylamine effect at 2 PM the next day for that guy. Average was 5.2 hours (so most reach it earlier than this).

\- Total ethylamine excreted in urine also varies, from complete removal after 24 hours to less than half removed. Many factors may play a role, but generally I'd say, again, highly individual metabolic speed.

I believe the glutamate that is also released by L-theanine metabolism yields quite low rises in concentration when compared to ethylamine, and this could be attributed to the fact that it is metabolised to L-glutamine or GABA for instance, and also that there are ample AA pumps that can transfer one of the most abundant neurotransmitters across the BBB to stabilise glutamate concentration in CSF.

&#x200B;

Regarding the following research papers:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00965771](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00965771) 

\- Ethylamine stimulates IP accumulation in rat cortical slices. GPCRs targeting PLC (muscarinic, alpha 1 adrenergic, 5-HT2,...). They tried  a lot of antagonists for the biggest receptors, none inhibited the effect. 

For me, mGluR group I comes to mind. Sigma-1 too. Or another mechanism by which it interacts with PLC to stack up on PImonophosphates.

In one of the papers it says that 1 daily dose of L-theanine, ranging from 250 to 1250 mg, is a good way to have at it and this may well be the case for many of us. 

So, L-theanine might be just getting to know your L-theanine metabolism and adjusting your dosage to this. If, after that, ethylamine effects are not what you desire, it just might not be for you.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, some conjecture:

Ethylamine is mentioned here, together with tryptamine. Although not much specific research is done regarding ethylamine, I'm categorizing it with PEA, tyramine, histamine and other abundant vegetal biogenic amines. It could have interactions at some of the same receptors (TAAR1 Gq would fit the profile). I also think ethylamine shares the same interactions with the receptor family GABA A, Glycine, A4B2 and 5-HT3 as ethanol.

Gq coupled receptors leading to PIP2/PLC pathway (and potentially affected by L-theanine):

"Effect of n-acetylcysteine (NAC) on my already elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST & GGT).",173,d4wwhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d4wwhs/effect_of_nacetylcysteine_nac_on_my_already/,90,1568644670.0,"October 1st 2018 prelude:

Basically I felt I was running low on gas. For days I felt exhausted at work, energy supply none.. Also I had huge lymph nodes in my neck and sweated extremely during my sleep. After I told the doctor these symptons he made me do a blood test and redirected me tot the hospital for examination on the lymph nodes out of precaution for lymphe node cancer. 

October 2nd 2018:  first blood test

ALT: 523
AST: 240
GGT: 566


The scan showed my lymph nodes were only swollen and there was no indication for lymph node cancer.  The blood test results were still bad. the doctor told me depending on the causes I was heading for liver failure. He made me do another blood test to see if I had EBV ( Epstein Bar Virus) and/or Cytomegalo virus , also known as CMV.  I tested positive on both viruses. EBV and CMV were also a legitimate argument for all symptons and the elevated liver enzymes.

October 10th 2018: 

ALT: 156
AST: 57
GGT: 389

only a week after the first test the results were looking already pretty positive. As assumed, the enzymes were progressing towards normal levels. The doctor told me to have no worries seeing the elevated enzyme levels had substantially decreased in such a short amount of time. 

 I thought i would be back to healthy levels quickly.. this was until I called the doctor a couple of months later in June 2019 to ask for another blood test.

June 27th 2019

ALT: 164
AST: 57
GGT: 140

Main story: after many months it turned out my enzyme levels still werent heading to healthy levels. after seeing these results I was literaly in battle mode. I started to do my own research about the causes of elevated liver enzymes and in particular GGT (main indicator of early mortality). High GGT can be an indicator of depleted glutathione which is basicaly the most important antioxidant in your body. My search for a supplement that raised glutathione levels in my body finally ended after finding n-acetylcysteine (NAC). Since july 20th I have been taking NAC 1x 600mg on a daily basis. 10 days ago i finally took another blood test.

August 29th 2019

ALT: 67 
AST: 30
GGT:  95

Roughly 2 months and 10 days after taking NAC on daily basis 1x 600mg capsule my elevated enzyme levels are finally going into the right direction. 

Another thing that has happened is that NAC has worked wonders for my blood pressure. I was always in the ranges of 150ish/78. Now my blood pressure has been steady for a couple of weeks in the ranges of 120ish-82. 

I wil keep you guys posted if there are people interested. So just wanted to share this with you guys.

Edit:

November 19th 2019 

ALT: 55
GGT: 86
AST: 29

Huge upset.. All enzymes have further progressed to healhy levels although I expected more than this.. I havent been taking my dosage as strictly as I used to so maybe that's the reason. 

December 2019:

I made the decision to stop taking NAC. I've been thinking more and more about the situation and it seems to me I am only fighting the symptons. Januari 23rd I have an appointed with a Liver specialist in the hospital. Until then!

The Ten Holy Commandments of Nootropics (WIP),176,8zmwde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8zmwde/the_ten_holy_commandments_of_nootropics_wip/,24,1531875650.0,"I have previously expressed a desire to write a list of ten commandments for new users to follow, all with the hope of minimising the many mistakes that those without proper guidance tend to make during their journey. Below is the first iteration of these ten rules, it is to be considered WIP and I am looking for as much feedback as I can get, especially in regards to filling rules 7 and 8 - feel free to point out any changes that might be necessary. This is all based on my own personal experiences/ those commonly mentioned throughout /r/Nootropics and should serve as only a very basic guideline.

**1. Always begin with the recommended dosage or lower.**

*The body of each individual is different and each will react differently to substances, many find it easy to fall for the trap of taking more than the recommended dosage - typically motivated by a misguided belief that a larger dose will lead to a better experience. If experimenting with something for the first time - take a smaller dose and see how your body reacts to it, failure to do so can range from nothing happening all the way to the unlikely scenario of your death. Safety is of paramount importance and we don't want to hear about how you almost died because you took 10,000mg of Phenibut.*

**2. More isn't necessarily better.**

*Many Nootropics begin taking effects, whether positive or negative, after weeks of usage, acclimate yourself to your current Nootropics, ideally one at a time, before adding even more into your stack. Failure to do so will often lead you into a situation where something is making you feel terrible but you're unable to tell what because you take twenty different Nootropics, forcing you to completely stop or gradually remove things from your stack.*

**3. Lower your expectations.**

*A significant portion of Nootropics that you will be dealing with will have very subtle effects - infact the effects of many cannot truly be felt and when they are, it is often a case of expectation bias or other imperfections of the human mind. Many nootropics will provide you with a very tiny boost, if a certain Nootropic improves your memory by 5%, are you going to be able to feel such a tiny improvement? It is unlikely that you will, but it does not mean that the Nootropic isn't working.*

**4. Do your research.**

*Your preferred source of information regarding any Nootropic should be peer reviewed scientific studies, preferably ones without any cause for bias (Many studies are funded by organizations which sell Nootropics). When dealing with more obscure substances, you may have to rely heavily upon anecdotal evidence in the form of the experiences of other people as formal scientific studies don't exist. When doing so, do not take the word of any individual as law and instead look for commonalities in people's experiences, if seven out of ten individuals say that a certain Nootropic has caused panic attacks in them, it is probably not a good idea to take that Nootropic.*

**5. Correlation doesn't equal causation.**

*If you begin to experience something negative while taking a Nootropic, take a good look at your situation and ask yourself what other factors could be causing your problem - jumping straight to the conclusion that it's the Nootropic you happen to be taking is the incorrect course of action and will prolong the amount of time before your problem is fixed. Your magnesium supplement is probably not the cause of your testicular rashes.*

**6. Order only from trusted sources.**

*There are many horror stories on the internet coming from individuals who as a result of ordering from a shady source have received heavy mental poisoning or other adverse effects - such situations are rare, but they do happen and since you are dealing with your health, you should minimise the possibilities of them happening by only acquiring your Nootropics from trusted sources. If you do not receive a product that damages your health, you might receive a product which is inferior in quality, rely upon established and respected methods of acquisition.*

**7. Read everything carefully.**

*Half the problems experienced by users of Nootropics and a vast majority of questions posed on this sub could easily be eliminated if one were to clearly read the information being put before them. Even during the creation process of this list, individuals were suggesting that things are included which are already included in the list.*

**8. Cycle.**

*Cycling refers to planned pauses in your taking of Nootropics, doing so allows for a variety of different benefits such as a reduced possibility of addiction, greater awareness of the effects of different Nootropics upon your body and the avoidance of negative health effects that come with overuse. It is also suggested that you do the other type of cycling which is greatly beneficial to your health.*

**9. Don't be an idiot.**

*Think about the consequences of your actions before you perform them, impulsivity and generally irresponsible behaviour is what causes countries to gradually ban many Nootropic substances which are a great boon to responsible users.*

**10. Nootropics are not a substitute for good habits and lifestyle choices.**

*Nootropics are unlikely to fix significant problems in your life, especially not in the long term, and a belief that a Nootropic can do so can easily lead to addiction. Nootropics (especially the more potent ones) should be respected and treated as tools which assist you in reaching what you want in life, but they should not be your sole means of doing so. No amount of Nootropics will stop you from being a useless piece of shit if you're a useless piece of shit.*",2018-07-18 06:30:50
Slowing down fapping has had the biggest impact then any substance i ever tried.,175,7f1p1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7f1p1i/slowing_down_fapping_has_had_the_biggest_impact/,148,1511491986.0,"Im not writing this to convince anyone about anything, i just want to write down my experience and maybe someone benefits from it.

I tried a whole bunch of stuff and while many things work in some way, they have their side effects as well. But nothing comes even close to abstaining from fapping for a while.

I intentionally wrote ""slowing"" in the title, as my experience has not much to do with the nofap hype. Abstaining from fapping for longer then a week has rather negative impacts for me, like losing interest in things, getting demotivated, unable to do things as im so hypersexual that i cant concentrate, etc. If i slow down from everyday fapping to every 3-4th day (ymmv), im a different person. Literally. And im writing this after several ""cycles"" of going back to my old self. 

Im self employed and get job offers for different things and with daily fapping im denying 70% of the stuff. With the slowed down fapping version of me, my whole week is full of work as im so darn happy and motivated, that i feel like im a different person. Besides that, my social anxiety is... gone. Im talkative like a parrot on cocaine. And all this without any side effects and for free.

Regarding porn, thats a whole different story. Being in a relationship since 17 years without sex since a few years, porn destroys my interest in woman - which is a good thing for me. But it doesnt destroy my motivation, doing it every 3rd or 4th day. For any single, i wouldnt recommend watching porn though. Makes sex much more intense and interesting.

So while this might be nothing new for many, it has such a big impact for my life, that i want to get it some attention and maybe someone benefits like i do.

Edit: I just realized, i wouldve never ever wrote this as my old self. ",2017-11-24 08:23:06

The Problem With Dopaminergics,176,8xyzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8xyzgf/the_problem_with_dopaminergics/,155,1531339473.0,"Instant vs Delayed Gratification

We are all chasing dopamine in our lives. Being a nootropics user for some time, I have come to realization that the time it takes for you to achieve gratification or dopamine release is one of the biggest factor of how we live our lives and how we progress though it.  People have been using a lot of agonists and receptor modulators in the nootropics community but if I had to pick the most powerful of them all, I would select dopaminergics. An increase in the dopamine not only makes us forget everything in our surroundings to achieve our goals but also gives an extreme feeling of high when one achieves these dreams. 

The problem starts when you have an artificial boost of dopamine in your body. Rapid receptor and enzyme down regulation to maintain a neurochemical balance hits the user. And then you want more and more to do less and less. Every goal involves time. And 'time' is the biggest enemy of someone who is using artificial boosts to stay afloat. Goals that require a few days to a week to get done seem easy, but as soon as we strive to achieve long term goals, we start suffering from the curse of cycling. Having down times, crashes, prolonged periods of low or no activity to get back to how we were functioning previously become a norm. Productivity decreases and the dose increases. We start to look for alternatives, synthetic precursors and receptor up regulators creep up in our stacks. While hating our down times we start fantasizing about our first dose effects. We revisit our first online posts about how great the supplement made us feel. We 'don't feel the same' again and begin to obsess over each supplement's mode of action. Going through hundreds of articles on PubMed does not bring the same honeymoon period back. We decide to quit cold turkey. Go for a reboot. More down times and more days are wasted. And after a few days we pick up the same stack again.

I have no problem with nootropics but the ones I love and hate at the same time are dopaminergics. Over the past few months I have started to come off most of my supplements. It was hard but it was worth effort. I now have a much better idea of who I am. I have started to listen to my body rather than throwing it off its balance every time I want to. We are neurologically diverse beings. Every one is different and no one comes with a manual. It takes time, energy and way more effort to write a manual for ourselves. But once you start familiarizing yourself with the inner workings of your mind, it becomes easier to accomplish tasks that you were 'too lazy' or 'too unmotivated' to accomplish. There are a lot of people amongst us who benefit from medications and supplements. Exhibiting anhedonia, mania, extreme inattention and dysphoria in life crosses that line between stable but biologically diverse beings and pathology. For those, having someone else ( a professional) give them insight about their problems and prescribing them appropriate medications is the only way to go. Self diagnosing without insight is dangerous and professional help is compulsory for them. But for the rest of us, keep it simple. Take time to learn about yourself first and then experiment later. You are capable of far more than you can imagine but no magic pill is going to fix everything. The stable dopamine release after achieving something because of working hard for an extended period of time will never be comparable to any motivation boosters. Getting hooked on that delayed surge makes us want more, bigger goals, bigger passion and bigger accomplishments are required to achieve the same boost again. This delayed gratification cycle has turned average people into giants. Craving success becomes a norm for them. The pursuit of this gratification wakes them up at 4 AM every day. It is easy for us to reward our children or pets with toys or treats after they accomplish something to reinforce their behavior, but hard for us to do the same for ourselves. The knowledge from accumulated from endless experiments on monkeys in laboratories is useless to us if we cannot practice self control for delayed gratification. These supplements may help you get out of your bed a few times, but not forever.

If you are looking into changing your stack, remember to give a good hard look at the list of dopaminergics that you are taking, you'll thank yourself later.",2018-07-12 01:34:33

I have been eating mackerel daily for two weeks now and I feel pretty great, for what it's worth. I also respond pretty well to soy lecithin derived phosphatidylserine supplements but they are just ludicrously expensive to get a dose of 300-500mg daily.

One normal sized Atlantic mackerel is 350g, of which 200g you can eat probably, which costs me 1 euro. That's up to 900mg phosphatidylserine for 1 euro, which is super cheap.

EDIT: Atlantic mackerel is also one of the lower mercury fish, so is safe for regular consumption.

EDIT: Maybe not. See /u/potifar's comment.",2018-12-04 10:51:32

"BNC210: anxiolytic outperforming Lorazepam without any effect on cognition, sedation, addictio potential",169,8oiot8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8oiot8/bnc210_anxiolytic_outperforming_lorazepam_without/,63,1528158822.0,"Hi, i think this is the real game changer for anxiolytic, i have not understand why on one ever tried it in this communty. 

""BNC210 is a novel small molecule, orally-administered drug candidate being developed for anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders, that we believe has similar efficacy but improved tolerability compared to currently available drugs such as benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. BNC210 is a first-in-class highly-selective negative allosteric modulator of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine (alpha-7) receptor. Acetylcholine and the alpha-7 receptor are increasingly being implicated in the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the alpha- 7 receptor is highly expressed in the amygdala, which forms part of the emotional centre of the brain. To date, BNC210 has been evaluated in seven completed clinical trials in over 200 subjects. Recruitment has just been completed in a Phase 2 PTSD trial.""

""The results of the study show that BNC210 induced statistically significant changes in cerebral perfusion (300mg BNC210, p<0.05) and also significantly reduced amygdala activation in response to fearful faces during the EFT (300mg BNC210, p<0.05). In comparison, lorazepam exerted a modest suppressive effect on amygdala activation during performance of the EFT (1.5mg lorazepam, p=0.069).

Extensive evidence indicates that the amygdala plays a major role in fear and anxiety reactions. The data from this study indicates that BNC210 may exert anti-anxiety effects in patients via suppression of amygdala activation.""


There is not much else to say about it: as strong as benzo without any of their known side effect (impaired cognition, addiction ecc), possibly could prevent panic attack.

EDIT:There is a lab that could sell 1g for 365, but considering that the dose ranges from 100 to 600mg its not worth it, if many people would like to buy we could do a group buy from a china lab and get it synthesised in bulk at a better cost.

What I learned from a blind self trial of 5 compounds,176,6m2rn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6m2rn9/what_i_learned_from_a_blind_self_trial_of_5/,50,1499569248.0,"###In short:
I tested piracetam, aniracetam, oxiracetam, noopept, N-acetyl cysteine, and a placebo for 5 days each. None of the compounds had significant effects* at the doses and durations tested. Blinding was simple, finding time without external stressors and confounds was challenging, and assessing relevant performance was extremely difficult. Inadequate assessments and, for the racetams, inadequate durations are the most likely limitations.

###Methods & Results

Over the course of seven weeks, I dosed for 5 days and left two days for clearance. I dosed either nothing, piracetam (800 mg), aniracetam (750 mg), oxiractam (750 mg), noopept (30 mg), N-acetyl cysteine (500 mg), or cornstarch placebo orally in capsules twice a day. I assessed reaction time and digit span (Human Benchmark) and subjective mood, energy, and mental sharpness on a scale of 1 - 10. I made no other supplement changes during this period, consuming typically two cups of tea, several vitamins, and collagen. I consumed alcohol twice during this period on clearance days.

I tested the means of each of the 5 measured values against placebo, for a total of 25 tests. None were significant at p = 0.01. At p = 0.05, only one was significant (piracetam worsens subjective energy by 0.6 out of 10), but given the number of tests, this is likely a false positive.

I noted an unusual number of headaches during noopept dosing (2 in 5 days vs ~0.5 per week typically). I had several trippy dreams on aniracetam. I did not try to quantitatively assess significance for these side effects.

###Discussion and Outlook

The lack of effect on measured variables could be because (1) none of the compounds are very effective for me (2) none of the compounds are very effective for me at that dose and dosing duration or (3) improvements are not reflected in the variables I measured.

It's possible that there are effects that are too small compared with the typical fluctuations. This is relatively uninteresting to me, as I am not interested in paying for supplements if the effects are much below the uncertainty here. That is, even though more data would allow smaller effects to be statistically significant, I likely would consider them not clinically significant.

The relatively short duration is a problem for racetams, and piracetam was likely underdosed. Finding extended periods of time without major external events is a bit tricky, so I would have to cut back to one compound to do a better, longer study. I was originally planning something longer but kept pushing it back to avoid trips, stressors, etc. and had to be less ambitious for this study.

I was not happy with any of the assessments I found. I wanted something that was unobtrusive to test during the afternoon and not very time consuming, hence the two quantitative and three subjective measures. For anything with a dramatic effect, I think I might see it, but subjective ratings of mental performance are rather questionable.

In general, I am OK with the statistical power of this experiment. I would consider doing longer experiments mainly to observe the effect of compounds that act less acutely. None of the compounds here seem particularly promising for me, but piracetam wasn't really given a fair chance. I would likely try different compounds in the future. Methodologically, I'm most interested in finding better assessments.

Though perhaps not a nootropic, I think next I may try a dose-dependent study of the effects of GABA. People claim that a non-null response to GABA indicates a damaged blood-brain barrier, but anecdotes are problematic due to placebo effect. It would be neat if we could build up some placebo-controlled evidence for whether individuals respond differently to GABA and maybe correlate that to the effectiveness of other things, so it could be used as a diagnostic. Well, maybe.

This is a bit long already, so I'll end it here, but I'm happy to go into more details if needed. It'd be nice to see more people doing this sort of thing, even if not quantitatively, at least doing a blind comparison when trying something for the first time.

*Edit:* Thanks for the feedback, everyone! To add some background, this was something I decided to do after already having gotten some compounds to try and was just meant to be one step up from trying them casually. It is a bit silly to try racetams for 5 days. (There seem to be plenty of anecdotes here of effects within a few days, but the more robust benefits should be after weeks.)

Even still, being consistent about routines, doing the assessments, and avoiding confounds actually takes some commitment. I had questioned whether it was worthwhile at the time, but the response here has convinced me. I don't think I'll try to test 5 compounds at once again, but I'll certainly do something in the future.",2017-07-09 08:30:48

Neurogenesis: what is it good for?,167,atmrx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/atmrx3/neurogenesis_what_is_it_good_for/,49,1550898072.0,"More than ""absolutely nothing,"" but another post today showed some people need to take a step back and get some perspective.

&#x200B;

Physically speaking, learning is the destruction of neural connections. We start life with a densely connected brain, and learning is the process of pruning the connections that don't contribute to success. On a variety of tasks, fMRI shows flurries of activities in untrained subjects, while experts' neural activity is minimal and efficient. Part of the etiology of autism may be an inability to prune useless connections (accounting particularly for the ""sensory overload"" part of the syndrome.)

&#x200B;

Neurogenesis, creating new neurons, is in direct opposition to this process of learning through destruction. It weakens memories that are not actively recalled and rehearsed. It's like shaking an etch-a-sketch. This is the leading hypothesis explaining infantile amnesia, and it can be replicated with drugs. Causing yourself to grow a bunch of new neurons will not make you smarter just for those neuron's existence. It will make you forget things.

&#x200B;

There are some ways this can be useful, but it has to be approached with goals in mind and a plan that's more sophisticated than ""more neurons = good"".

1. In the elderly, neurogenesis falls below the replacement rate, so the benefits of sleep, exercise, and basic nutrition are mostly a matter of retaining rather than enhancing ability.
2. If you are about to embark on learning something completely unfamiliar in late adulthood, like playing violin when you've never touched an instrument in your life, massive neurogenesis might help you learn at a rate more similar to your younger self. If you take something like NSI-189 and don't follow up with intense and specific training you're just burning existing skills for nothing.
3. In some cases un-learning is therapeutic, as with phobias or PTSD.
4. Someone who has suffered stroke or TBI has less to lose, so it makes a lot of sense to funnel everything into future potential.
5. The sense of newness and brighter colors with NSI-189 are because the sense of what things are routine in life is being unlearnt. If that's important to you for an antidepressant effect or just recreationally, I won't say you're wrong to do that, just understand what it is you're doing.",2019-02-23 10:31:12

I've noticed that this subreddit receives many posts from users complaining from brain fogg, fatigue and mood swings. However, I rarely see any information pointing out the relationship between thyroid illness and the symptoms induced by having a Hyper/Hypo-thyroid. 

There is a very large percentage of people who suffer most of their life from the symptoms mentioned above because they go undiagnosed. Unfortunately, thyroid health is often overlooked by care professionals, and will only be considered when the symptoms become unbearable for patient.

You should always ask your doctor to order a hormone panel when you feel that something is wrong with your health. If you're not functioning at normal, healthy level, then it's because your body is trying to tell you that something is out of balance. Never ignore your symptoms, even if your doctor tells you otherwise!

If your GP refuses to conduct a hormone panel test, then at the very least you should consider ordering the test yourself. The most basic test is a TSH blood work, which is less than $40 on many self-referral lab orders. I recommend Walkinlabs, but there are many others out there. Make sure to check out customer reviews before ordering.

Youtube's War on Nootropics- A call to arms!,166,8flw6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8flw6l/youtubes_war_on_nootropics_a_call_to_arms/,85,1524970230.0,"It looks like YouTube is aggressively going after fellow neuronauts and taking down their nootropic channels. I find this rather alarming because it may be a harbinger of things to come. It is possible that this is just harmless good ole profiteering. That is, drug companies are putting pressure on yt to take down the nootropic channels lest the population figures out that they don't need government-approved pharmaceuticals to take care of their biological and psychological health. However, it seems to me that there is a larger ideological agenda at work, and if so, then this will have consequences for the rest of us. I think that there are people out there who don't believe that individuals should take responsibility for their self. Your brain and your body belong to the state, and any attempts to think for yourself and take control of your biology have to be undermined and stopped. I'm aware that this is a political post, and apologies if I have broken any community guidelines. I do think that we may be under attack by dark, sluggish, and slow-thinking mental midgets.

A Review of Several “Cutting Edge” Nootropics,165,5jqfwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5jqfwd/a_review_of_several_cutting_edge_nootropics/,113,1482440345.0,"Over the past year or so, there have been several nootropics that have gained significant attention on this sub. I thought that I would share some anecdotes and thoughts after experimenting at length with them in hopes that my experiences may help others. Keep in mind that I have ADHD-PI, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and a lengthy (8+ year) history with depression as preexisting conditions. In my experience, when those items are addressed, I function at my best. Finally, keep in mind that all of these anectdotes are a n=1 situation. While I have had a variety of particular effects, you may not.


- Ibudilast: Potent anti-inflammatory effects that manifest quite quickly. My chronic back pain decreased to barely noticeable levels, it cut down on allergies drastically,  and it clears brain fog/increases mental energy nearly as well as Intranasal Insulin. The only issue is that it seemed to exacerbate my ADHD symptoms to the point of intolerability. After looking into it more, Ibudilast significantly increases cAMP levels (Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8032594), which have been strongly correlated with ADHD symptomology. This would actually oppose one of the mechanisms of a2 agonists used for ADHD such as guanfacine, which lowers cAMP. Anyway, Ibudilast is something that many may find beneficial to combat chronic pain, brain fog, and other aspects of inflammation by preventing gilial cell activation in the first place. If you have brain fog or allergies, this one deserves a trial run. Check PubMed for a score of studies on its use for a variety of disorders, and its ability to prevent tolerance/withdrawal with amphetamines and opiates. Check pub med with the keyword ""Ibudilast"" and http://www.lostfalco.com to learn more.

- BPC-157: This compound is fascinating, and has a wide range of effects. I took ~150mcg orally and sublingually for a month hoping that it would help heal a back injury I had sustained. It did not help with this ROA, but my first several doses felt strong, like something was being “reset”. Those changes were not felt after that time, but even several weeks after taking an extended amount of time off, my baseline seems to be permanently raised. I feel calmer in general and it is easier to focus on mundane tasks. Additionally, my digestive system which was prone to occasional issues has also been operating much smoother after this trial. Recently, I have tried ~10 days of using 150mcg with a DMSO carrier on my back injury, and it seems to be having the effects I was going for when I started taking the oral dose. I have decided to do a cycle of injections near the injury site to see if I can further assist the healing process. Be advised, this substance causes significant angiogenesis, which is a double edged sword: it helps the healing process, but could “supercharge” cancer growth if you have pre-existing cancer. I am relatively young, and had necessary check-ups and a blood panel prior to experimenting with this substance. Check pub med with the keyword ""BPC-157"" as well as a general reddit search to learn more.

- TDCS: By far the most disappointing of the bunch. It actually lowered my mood, working memory, cognitive ability, and put me in a deep brain fog after several days of use. The only positive that was occurring was the ability to sleep deeply, at almost any time. This trend did not change even with changing the montages from T3-FP2 to the DARPA montage. While ~50% of people did not respond or had the opposite intended response in studies, I may have identified what may be the cause for some (at least for me). After one of my several day trials, I was having trouble completing basic tasks at work, and decided to do some research. I found TDCS increases inflammation (Source:http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043776), in addition to increasing astrocytes and gilial cell activation (Source:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976108/). Further, when I took an NSAID (anti-inflammatory), and 10IU’s of Intranasal Insulin (gilial cell inhibitor), the brain fog was lifted immediately, and my issues with mood and working memory went away completely. I think that TDCS has great potential for many, but probably not those with pre-existing inflammation and/or allergy issues. If you are looking for a good resource, the TDCS sub here on reddit is good, in addition to http://totaltdcs.com/. 

- Intranasal Insulin: By far the most impressive substance I have tried so far for nootropic purposes. In ~4 months of on and off use, it clears brain fog, increases mental energy, lowers anxiety (especially in social situations), lowers perceived stress levels and improves my memory. It really is the whole package, and appears to be the nootropic holy grail that many on this sub are looking for. The only negatives about Intranasal Insulin are the unknown long term effects and the use of some dubious “preservatives” to keep it from spoiling/decomposing. These have been enough for me to stop using it until more research comes out. Be advised, within a week of ceasing IN-I, I returned to my previous baseline, so the benefits only last as long as one is taking IN-I. I used anywhere from 10-40 IU’s a day, with the sweet spot being 20 IU’s (10 in the morning, 10, after dinner). It doesn’t appear to interact with any other supplements, and also clears out cannabis induced brain fog reliably. If your risk aversion is low, give this one a try, you won’t be dissapointed. See /u/lostfalco ’s website here for more information on how to get started (http://www.lostfalco.com/intranasal-insulin/). 

- Pirlindole: This substance was disappointing for me. Not only did it actually seem to make my depression worse after several days, but my cognition was negatively impacted. Sleep and mood improved the first three days of consumption, before it fell off a cliff. On paper, this substance seemed especially promising, but I had to quit after a week and a half, as it had gotten me into a very rough spot. There was no withdrawal to speak of during this process, and it may be helpful for those with different wiring and neurochemistry. Check out pub med with the keyword ""Pirlindole"" to learn more.

- Microdosing Psychedelics: I have tried substances from both the phenylethylamine family and a lysergimide in my experimentation. They were both safely combined with Polygala Tenuifolia in my experience, but do your own research and come to your own conclusions. Microdosing/low dose psychedelics in my experience are very peculiar, and the headspace they provide are phenomenal for enhancing curiosity, working through personal issues and creative thinking. To elaborate, it increases my intuition on life in general, as well as augment empathy, existentialist thinking, general openness, problem solving ability for various social situations, and understanding of philosophical concepts. With the latter, it helps me “feel” them rather than just interact with them intellectually. It magnifies whatever emotions I am currently experiencing, so I have found that picking days where I am spending several hours in nature doing what I love to have the greatest impact.  I have found it to be less helpful in the workplace (probably due to the type of work I am involved with), as it does not function as a typical nootropic. The main benefits seem to be emotional and spiritual in nature, and the “recharge” I get from a low (threshold) dose lasts for a couple months. If you interested in this, I suggest reading The Psychedelic Traveler's Guide by James Fadiman, along with checking out /r/rationalpsychonaut and /r/microdosing.

I have found a combination that works very well, but my curiosity will get the best of me and I will likely cycle off some of what I am taking and try some new things (Polygala will stay in my stack). My next stops are trying Palmitoylethanolamide, MK-677 and P21 (if I can swallow the cost) separately in the coming months. I plan on taking MK-677 for general gym related endeavors, with the hope of synergizing with the BPC-157 injections for some healing of my back injury. I am curious to see if there will be any nootropic benefits, as some have alluded to. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about these substances above (or others), and I will do my best to answer them. Cheers!

* Note - Possible Contradictions: During these trials (except while taking Pirlindole, and some of my experiments with microdosing), I was taking 3x 100mg Polygala Tenuifolia extract for anti-depressive purposes, 1400mg fish oil, a b vitamin complex, 10,000IU’s of Vitamin D, and 200mg elemental Magnesium from Magnesium Glycinate. I have taken this stack daily for 6+ months, so my baseline from this stack was clearly defined prior to attempting these trials. I have also meditated for 30-40 minutes daily during this time, with light to moderate physical activity.",2016-12-23 02:29:05

NAC seems to be having a profound effect. And I think it may be due to it's antioxidant properties.,165,b67id9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/b67id9/nac_seems_to_be_having_a_profound_effect_and_i/,172,1553738700.0,"In 2016 I thru-hiked the AT and in 2018 I biked 2,500 miles and followed that up with a 1,860 mile hike. After these big events I've noticed a pronounced decrease in my overall energy, motivation, and sense of well-being. I've basically felt like I aged 10 years after these trips. I'd chalked it up to just general extreme overtraining and thought it might require years to recover or that possibly I'd simply pushed my body too hard and this was my new baseline.

I was listening to Joe Rogan Podcast #700 last week where they had a SF soldier on with a doctor who was treating him for depression/fatigue/TBI symptoms.

They mentioned on the show how NAC, a simple cheap supplement could have prevented the soldier from experiencing his symptoms if he was supplementing with it during his time overseas. They didn't really expand on this - it was more of an offhand comment but that made me start digging.

Well apparently NAC has been widely studied and shown to have positive effects on a whole host of disease. Here's a good article that sums up a lot of the research: [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nac-benefits#section5](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nac-benefits#section5)

What I'm really interested in is the ability of NAC to protect against Oxidative Stress.

>Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage.

Basically, oxidative stress causes damage to your body at a cellular level which then can cause a whole host of different diseases.

Based on what we know about exercise's role in oxidative stress doing a thru-hike should dramatically increase levels of oxidative stress

>An increase in exercise intensity is one of the many ways in which oxidative stress and free radical production has been shown to increase inside our cells.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129149/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129149/)

Exercise in general is good because it will cause an acute increase in oxidative stress but then our body increases its ability to deal with oxidative stress so it's a net positive for our health. However it would be logical to conclude that the sort of exercise you do during a thru-hike, namely 10-14 hours of exercise a day, everyday, for months on end would lead to a net negative effect when it comes to oxidative stress on our bodies. This hasn't been proven out in studies but this seems logical.

Now here's an interesting study:

>**Oxidative stress levels are raised in chronic fatigue syndrome and are associated with clinical symptoms.**  
>  
>This is the first time that raised levels of the gold standard measure of in vivo oxidative stress (isoprostanes) and their association with CFS symptoms have been reported. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16085177](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16085177)

In addition to exercise causing oxidative stress another main source of oxidative stress comes from foods cooked with processed vegetable oils(so basically 3/4ths of a hiker's diet, chips, ramen, snack cakes, etc.)..

Now our body's primary way to combat oxidative stress is through antioxidants. Well a hiker's diet is also hugely lacking in antioxidants. NAC is a fantastic antioxidant and appears to protect the body against oxidative damage.

>N-Acetyl-L-cysteine Protects the Enterocyte against Oxidative Damage by Modulation of Mitochondrial Function.  
>  
>NAC supplementation remarkably increased (*P* < 0.05) proliferation rate, antioxidation capacity, and mitochondrial bioenergetics but decreased cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that NAC might rescue the intestinal injury induced by H2O2. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149690/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5149690/)

There's quite a few anecdotes floating around of NAC seeming to have a miraculous effect for people's fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Here's a thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8rkdfm/nac\_is\_absolutely\_amazing\_its\_changing\_my\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8rkdfm/nac_is_absolutely_amazing_its_changing_my_life/)

&#x200B;

On the face it seems that such a simple supplement shouldn't exert such a profound effect but I think perhaps the mechanism of action is through its antioxidant properties where it's helping the body to fight against oxidative stress.

I recently started taking 2g of NAC/day and it's had an immediate and profound impact. Most notably I'm motivated again and have my energy back. Ever since coming back from the CDT I've been in a rather ahedonic state. It's been slowly improving with time but I'd say over the last 6 months I went from a 1 to 5 on the energy/motivation scale and with this week of taking NAC I've gone from a 5 to a 8 literally overnight. Same thing happened to me after the AT. Took months before I started to feel normal again. This time with the CDT my recovery seemed to be slower then when I was on the AT.

I'd like to hear from others that have experienced benefit from NAC. Looking back on your lifestyle do you think oxidative stress could have been a key factor that was causing your fatigue/depression/whatnot? ",2019-03-28 07:35:00

Fish oil has a powerful mood stabilizing effect on me,163,elnyr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/elnyr4/fish_oil_has_a_powerful_mood_stabilizing_effect/,117,1578488127.0,"Fish oil could be for me the best antidepressant pill I have ever taken (apart from Xanax,Paroxetine and other drugs like weed) (Also I don't take those anymore, my stack could be pretty much Fish oil, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Magnesium, and a low fodmap diet and Meditation)

It doesn\`t sedate me or stimulate me, it's just ""regulates"" my mood. I stop feeling anguish, bad, sad, lonely or restless. I just feel normal. This is the experience I have from taking it many years.

Everytime I stop taking it, it is very subtle and as days pass it gets stronger, but I start to feel more emotional, Music affects me more, I get more anxious, I start to think more subjectively bad, like loneliness (without any real indication of that), things start to stress me more, I feel more irritated. etc... after about a week, I go back to feeling my old depressive same. But when I take fish oil, It takes about an hour or two and I start to feel just good again. I see everything more clearly, like my problems are fucking stupid, and I get much more grounded. its not euphoric or anything, it just stabilizes it.

What could that means for me?, What could be my mental disorder in this case?, Before fish oil I used to do a lot of drugs to be away from depression, I had long lasting atypical depression. very emotional. I hated myself.

I took a lot of therapy to accept my condition but it was hard everyday, now things are much easier.

Aniways, also, What could be in good synergy with fish oil?, that could enhance its effects?

Anyone notice having a basic healthy lifestyle working out better than nootropics?,163,6lbsrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6lbsrg/anyone_notice_having_a_basic_healthy_lifestyle/,89,1499257193.0,"I'm personally quite fascinated by nootropics and on a fairly regular basis take CBD, black seed oil, probiotics, creatine, glycine, and NAC. And of course coffee daily. All of which are big names in the nootropic game and should have me feeling awesome most the time, but nope.

I notice even regularly taking all of those, if I don't get enough sleep, good diet, exercise, and meditation I'll still feel fairly out of it. Especially when not getting enough sleep.

On the other hand if I do the aforementioned sleep/diet/exercise/meditation and heavily cut down or stop the nootropics (except coffee, gotta have that) I'll actually be feeling pretty awesome compared to the opposite.

I think there's a lot to nootropics and the right one can help someone a lot (I still think they nonetheless have helped me a good amount, especially the CBD), but I often wonder if some people downplay the importance of basic lifestyle choices of getting enough sleep, having a good diet, exercising, and also doing meditation regularly and instead seek a pill or substance that will make them feel like the guy from *Limitless* whereas basic healthly living choices are a much more guaranteed and long term way to feel like that.

I still love coffee though and feel it's definitely a nootropic I'll continue taking regardless. Thoughts on all this?",2017-07-05 17:49:53
9 Months of Nootropics Experiments Condensed for Beginners - My Journey [Long Read with TLDR],166,29xuls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/29xuls/9_months_of_nootropics_experiments_condensed_for/,47,1404641609.0,"Hey guys, it was 9 months ago (October 2013) when I tried nootropics for the first time. They’ve had a big impact on my life, but I remember that when I was starting out it all seemed pretty confusing. At that time, I really enjoyed reading other people’s experiences and recommendations. So now, 9 months later, I’m hoping I can save people some time by sharing my journey.
******
I’m going to talk about all the different nootropics I’ve tried, what I’ve learned and the impact nootropics have had on my life. Please note that these are just my experiences -- everyone is different and you may not get the same results as me. 

Hope you find it useful, or at the very least, interesting :)  

**Some background:**
I stumbled upon nootropics when I was studying for midterm exams at Princeton in the fall. I was behind in a couple of my classes -- I knew I could still do well on my exams but I needed to make the most of every day. I heard about CILTEP and I read the whole longecity thread before ordering Artichoke Extract and Forskolin from Amazon. That combination is what got me excited about nootropics.

I ended up taking a hiatus from school to start **[Luminate Focus](http://www.luminatefocus.com)** based on the CILTEP blend, but that’s a whole other story.  
*****

### My Nootropic Experiences  


## CILTEP -- My first and favorite nootropic stack

**Consists of:**
[Essential] Artichoke Extract or Zembrin (PD4E Inhibitor) + Forskolin (cAMP increase)
[Supplementary] ALCAR, L-Phenylalanine (I prefer Tyrosine), Caffeine (most people who have good results take CILTEP with coffee/caffeine, but the effects feel very different from coffee/caffeine alone)

**Benefits:**
On some days I experienced extremely intense concentration and motivation to study/learn. On other days, there wasn't quite the same intensity of focus, but I still noticed a drastic increase in wakefulness/alertness that lasted throughout the day. I had no need to nap in the afternoon and I could keep working all day (I haven’t tried modafinil so can’t make a comparison…). I also slept much more deeply. I found it much easier to meditate -- I could be present/focus for 20 minutes of meditation VERY easily compared to usual. I also found that it made the effects of caffeine stronger, and last longer.

**Drawbacks:**
I developed a tolerance after a few weeks if I didn't take days off. Sometimes my short-term memory was affected (especially if I took too much Forskolin). Once in a while I would experience a mild headache which went away if I worked out or even did a few sets of push-ups.

**My Recommendations:**
I found that playing around with the Artichoke/Forskolin ratio was helpful -- too little forskolin and you won’t get as much of the deep focus effect, too much and you may notice odd changes in your short term memory, increased heart rate, etc.

Also, taking a capsule of Artichoke Extract in the afternoon gave the effects a nice boost. Personally, I found Zembrin more subjectively beneficial for me than Artichoke Extract.

**If it doesn't work for you:**
Try it on an empty stomach, and when you are well rested. I found that if I didn’t sleep enough it would bring me up to a baseline, but I didn’t get quite the same effect as if I slept well. Also, I found that taking an acetylcholine precursor or acetylcholinesterase inhibitor helped.

**If/when you develop tolerance:** I took a few days off and I also used galantamine for three days (be careful with this). 

**Overall:**
I REALLY like CILTEP. It’s kind of hard to describe. It allows me to direct my attention. I feel like I have complete control over my day. I would go as far as describing it as “life-changing” but I might have been below a baseline of performance before.

Because it gave me an incredibly strong effect, I didn’t question whether nootropics were placebo or not. It kind of served as a “gateway” if that makes sense. Hats off to Abelard Lindsay.

## Caffeine + L-Theanine

Like the beginner’s guide says, I’d recommend this stack for anyone looking to wet their feet with nootropics. The 1 (Caffeine):2 (L-Theanine) ratio works well for me, but in order for me to *really* feel the L-Theanine I need to take it on a empty stomach.

My favorite dosage is 200mg Caffeine and 400mg of L-Theanine immediately before writing. It helps me to be very relaxed, not filter my thoughts, and achieve a “flow” state. This stack combined with music from MajesticCasual or TheSoundYouNeed YouTube channels is pretty amazing for writing. BTW, for some people 400mg of L-Theanine is too much and may make you drowsy (though not for me).

L-Theanine helps reduce anxiety, but I try to make sure I meditate instead of relying on L-Theanine. I save it for when I am writing.

## Phenylpiracetam

The first time I tried phenylpiracetam I was amazed. It felt like a much cleaner and stronger version of caffeine.

I noticed the effects very quickly (maybe 20-30m after taking 100mg-200mg sublingually on an empty stomach).

**Benefits:**
Euphoria, vividness of colors/sensory perceptions, increased motivation, increased physical endurance, basically TONS of energy. When taken at a higher dose I sometimes experienced tunnel vision from it.

**Drawbacks:**
(1) Tolerance develops quickly if you take it daily
(2) This is my own personal problem, but I found I relied on it too much. For example I would say “oh if I don’t sleep well I can just take it”. Then I would want to take more and it wouldn’t work as well. I also noticed an increase in blood pressure (happens with stimulants). So this is more my own problem, but I don’t use this anymore.

That said I think it’s a cool thing to experience, and also use once in a while.

## Piracetam

Compared to phenylpiracetam I found this much more subtle.

**Benefits:**
Overall increase in sense of well being, meditation/mindfulness is easier, slightly improved visual perception, more creativity (I *think*), more sensitive to caffeine (reduced tolerance).

**How I use it:**
I take 1.6g 1-2x a day with CILTEP. If I take piracetam I also take citicholine (vs. AlphaGPC). AlphaGPC sometimes give me headaches. I’ve tried up to 4.8g of Piracetam at once. I do this sometimes to see what something feels like, and then I reduce the dose. 

## Rhodiola Rosea (Cycling off of caffeine/coffee, though with a bit of Yerba Mate)

I only tried this very recently. I used it to cycle off of coffee/caffeine (I got the idea to try this from someone's Reddit comment).

For the last 6 months I worked ~12+ hours/day, travelled a lot, and had a very erratic sleep schedule. I also took on some debt in order to fund a nootropics company and that caused some anxiety. If you’ve been in this kind of a situation you’ll know that it makes sleeping really hard even if you budget enough hours (your mind constantly races thinking of new ideas, or anxiety makes it difficult to sleep well).

Cycling off of caffeine is hard if you’ve relied on it for a while (200mg-600mg/day). You get headaches and feel really tired. I made sure to get enough sleep during this period (7-8 hours/night) and I took 2 caps of Rhodiola/day. I slowly eased into this by switching from coffee to 1 cup of Yerba Mate per day, and then after a few days to no caffeine.

It was hard, but Rhodiola helped a lot.

## Magnesium, Melatonin, Huperzine A/Galantamine (optional) and Meditation for sleep

Improving my sleep was a game changer for me. I became a much happier, nicer, and more productive person.

I found that taking ~400mg of Magnesium (Citrate in my case) improved the quality of my sleep and stopped my mind from racing. On some days I would combine this with 1mg of Melatonin. Once in a while I also take Huperzine A OR Galantamine. I found this improved my sleep, but you might get crazy dreams from doing this, and if you take these regularly it can be problematic.

I found that not working late at night made a big difference so that I wasn’t thinking about things I had to do the next day.

**My favorite pre-bed routine:**
Take ~400mg of Magnesium, 1mg of Melatonin, and then go for a walk at the beach (to relax/unwind). Come back to apartment, brush teeth, change, etc. and go sit on my bed with a pillow against the wall and observe my breath (mindfulness). At some point when feeling extremely relaxed, lie down and fall asleep.

## Other things I have tried that are not mentioned above: 
Choline Bitartrate, Vinpocetine, Sunifiram, NALT, creatine
*****

**How nootropics improved my life:** My general view is that having the fundamentals in place is the most important thing (diet and sleep), but intrestingly I found that the effects of nootropics motivated me to get those things in place again. See, we all KNOW that we SHOULD get enough sleep, eat well, etc. and you do that you feel great, but why don’t you? When you don't feel good it's hard to get the motivation and remember what it feels like to dominate your day. What I mean is the amazing clarity of thought and motivation I felt reminded me what it feels like when you have your diet and sleep in check + a little bit more. This sounds kind of cheesy but they really helped get me started on a positive upward spiral of motivation.

**Other things I like for productivity/cognition/overall well-being**

* Meditation 1-2x/day (20m/session) || Reduces anxiety, helps you think clearly and objectively || *I've gotten good at doing this routinely*
* Getting enough sleep and optimizing the quality || *I do an OK job of this but it could be better*
* Reducing caffeine intake (no more than 200mg for me/day -- I have also eliminated it for weeks at at time) *Happy with my progress on this*
* Not checking email until later in the day and having specific exciting goals/priorities to work towards *Good at this*
* Playing outdoors (e.g. sports) - great for reducing stress - give yourself permission to have fun and play ||  *Need to get better at this*
* Diet (eliminate junk food, empty carbs, having more smaller meals throughout the day instead of giant ones) *I don't eat junk food, but I could improve diet/timing*
* Don’t take yourself so seriously || *I need to work on this one*
* Eating meals with family/friends || *I need to work on this one*

*****
## TL:DR;

1. CILTEP - Biggest impact on my life -- my absolute favorite (with Zembrin) and my base (I cycle off on weekends)
2. Caffeine + L-Theanine - Great intro stack, I love it for writing, goes well w/CILTEP
3. Piracetam - Subtle effects, overall sense of well being, stacks well w/CILTEP
4. Phenylpiracetam - Very noticeable effects very quickly, stacks well w/CILTEP. I don’t take this anymore for reasons mentioned above.
5. Citicoline - Stacks well with CILTEP as well as with Piracetam. I prefer this to AlphaGPC.
6. Huperzine A/Galantamine - Good for increasing REM sleep, but I use it more for removing CILTEP tolerance once in a while
7. Rhodiola Rosea - Helped me a lot when cycling off of coffee. I took some Yerba Mate as well to make the transition from coffee easier.
8. Magnesium citrate (pre-bed) with ~1mg melatonin -- then go sit on bed and meditate

Log: 7 Days Without Sugar,164,4xedd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/4xedd5/log_7_days_without_sugar/,151,1471047941.0,"**tl;dr takeaways: I feel as if my testosterone has increased (mainly due to replacing carbs with quality sources of saturated fats, and protein); I feel more desire to lift and less social anxiety; I have less fatigue and daytime tiredness; far less prone to depression and rumination (not 100%, but hugely improved!!); generally no more sugar cravings by the 7th day and excited to continue these newfound habits.**

**Would I recommend limiting sugar to <30 grams, and processed sugars to 0g? Definitely. I'm looking forward to further improvement over a longer time horizon.** We need to be mindful. Did I actually enjoy the sugary foods I used to eat, or did I just think I did? I think I used those foods as emotional dopamine outlets, and they weren't actually that enjoyable in the first place. No more.

I have come across so many articles concerning the negative effects of sugar on cognition, mood, hormone regulation, and all sorts. However, due to both my personal lack of discipline perhaps, combined with the ubiquity of sugar nowadays, I have decided to start a log.

Each day I will give you a brief overview of my diet, exercise, sleep quality, and meditation (if I choose to do it); *the four natural nootropics*, so to speak.

This log will start tomorrow. This log is only for personal benefit and hopefully will be interesting to others, however it will only be anecdotal. Note: I am 22, male, relatively healthy with no apparent health issues, however I do experience fatigue, lethargy, mild insomnia occasionally, and dysthymia. I sense these will be helped with a stricter diet.

I currently consume far too much sugar (100g+), albeit not as much as some people (200g+)! My sleep isn't great, and exercise is sporadic. I hope to ""shore these up"" over the next week and report my results. I hope some people will upvote this thread to indicate interest, so I'm not talking to myself (however, do as you please)! :)

Core supplementary intake: <3g quality fish oil, 4000mg calcium citrate, 4000iu Vitamin D3, 200mcg Vitamin K1, a basic multivitamin, a ""Vitamin B Complex"", green tea extract (450mg), zinc, and magnesium. Providing you with all the detailed breakdowns would be a bit overkill, but this should give you a clear picture. I also have been taking melatonin on and off to help me sleep. I have also introduced iron recently, as my tiredness I thought could be a sign of anemia - I will phase this out.

**tl;dr of log: No more sugar crashes; a greater desire to lift weights; sleep has not improved hugely but is not bad and I feel it will get better; on ""good"" days I feel in a better + more energetic mood than before; on ""bad"" days I feel less of a tendency to deal with problems through depression and instead feel like getting shit done.**

**Other important independent variables: reduced my cardio to very little; started lifting full body with a greater focus on compound lifts; started eating far more saturated fat from coconut oil (thought to help boost testosterone, if not just from the sat. fat) and other sources like peanut butter, almond butter, etc.**

*Day 1: August 13th, 2016*: Weighed in at 179.4 lbs (5'10""). The previous night I went to a restaurant so I'm heavier than usual. Just completed a morning workout (45 mins weightlifting, 25 mins of light cardio, burned over 250 calories). At 9:30AM I consumed 120 grams of chia seeds, 35 grams of a vegan protein blend, and 10 grams of organic cacao powder. It's too early yet, but I feel positive. Usually I would have had something sugary after the gym. After ~1PM I actually had a small nap, so the tiredness is still there clearly (despite ""feeling good""). I woke up at ~2PM and now having almond butter, cashews, sesame seeds, and a nuts & seeds cereal. At ~4PM I had some tomatoes and kale (blended) plus spirulina and vegetable powder (haven't counted the calories from the latter). @6PM I'm feeling good. Despite the nap earlier on, I had no sugar crashes today. I actually feel like lifting again (I might do later). Finished the day eating with family, which ruined the calorie counting (I'm not sure why I bothered). I had chicken, salmon, some linguine, pesto, spinach. Nothing sugary. For the day I had less than 20g sugar, over 100g protein, ample fat and fibre.

*Day 2: August 14th, 2016*: As explained before, I will be as honest and as objective as possible, reporting the negative and positive. Today I honestly woke up quite sluggishly, and needed more sleep than usual. My head feels a bit off, but I'm making sure to get enough water. No appetite yet (10AM). I went on a bike ride. Later @3PM ate my first food: chia seeds, low-sugar yogurt (and the sugars were lactose; nothing added; I didn't finish it), over 30 grams of coconut oil. A bit later I had 200 grams of kale, with some flaxseeds and olive oil. I feel OK but tired. I could probably sleep right now (6PM) but I won't. @7PM I had two almond butter sandwiches. I will finish later with some more vegetables. No energy for weightlifting unfortunately, I will plan to lift tomorrow. Presumably had no fructose today. Total sugar intake must have been <30 grams, and any sugar that I did have besides the lactose would have come from the organic almond butter (not much) and seeded wholemeal bread (not much). Still, I will aim for even lower total sugar tomorrow. Still no fruit! (P.S. I expect like some have suggested, this may later become a 30-day log; I don't think the full transition will be easy.)

*Day 3: August 15th, 2016*: I woke up @6AM despite going to bed eventually past maybe 12AM. However I don't feel sluggish, and feel just fine. Roughly by 7AM I had a high-fat meal: 50g+ of coconut oil and almond butter with chia seeds and bran flakes. I'm trying to incorporate coconut oil into my diet a lot now as I've heard it is a great source of fat, and can even boost testosterone in men (anecdotally, and there have been [relevant studies in mice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22439438)). Also just had the rest of the previous day's yogurt with cashews and a couple almonds. Had a short nap midday to recoup some lost sleep. @1.30PM I had two almond butter and coconut oil sandwiches (toasted); I'm glad to now have coconut oil in my life (recommended)! I also had over two servings of coffee (a quick swallow with water, cold) to create some more energy for lifting. @3PM finished a solid full body workout (inc. deadlifts) plus some push ups in the sunny UK weather. I'm lucky to be on annual leave during this test. @6PM+, just a note, I do feel very good right now. This follows the heavy lifting and high-fat, low-sugar food intake today, with lots of Vitamin D (pill form + natural sun). @8PM had 200 grams of spinach, some couscous/rice and pasta type foods (outside with family), peppers, and mushrooms, and also because I was hungry: one slice of my seeded, wholemeal bread with almond butter. That's it for the day (<30 grams of sugar; OK but I was aiming for lower. It's actually tricky as you get closer to 0, as almost everything contains *some* sugar). @11PM+ big craving for sugar before bed - I won't be having any though.

*Day 4: August 16th, 2016*: Woke up @5:30AM with probably five hours sleep; strange. I may recoup some sleep again later, we'll see. @8:30AM I ate a salmon fillet + a coconut-oil heavy sandwich again, with seeded, wholemeal bread. Had 3 slices of wholemeal, seeded bread about midday with lots of coconut oil and peanut butter. Had chia seeds and flax seeds also. For dinner I had ratatouille with chicken. In total, I most likely had less than 20 grams of sugar today (from the bread and ""organic"" peanut butter). No naps. No workout, but I was walking leisurely outside with family for 3-5 hours or so.

*Day 5: August 17th, 2016*: Woke up fine. Slept OK. Something very bad financially happened to me yesterday, however I am OK. In the morning, I had two heavy peanut butter and coconut oil sandwiches with 150 grams of chicken. I also had kale and spinach. It seems like my body composition (fat vs. lean mass) is improving despite not being in a deficit. I don't get bloated as often, if at all, and I don't feel like collapsing anymore after sugar crashes. This is good. I don't even crave sugar that much, though bear in mind my sugar intake is not 0, just low (30 grams at most, and typically in the 15-20 gram range). @12.30PM I had quite a lot: slice of seeded, wholemeal bread, peanut butter, chia seeds, protein powder, coconut oil and flax seeds. After some full body lifting I had more protein powder and another almond butter & coconut oil sandwich with chia seeds. Probably eating too much today but I felt like it after lifting. @8PM had dinner: pesto pasta with chicken and runner beans.

*Day 6: August 18th, 2016*: Slept OK last night. @9AM I had a protein shake with coconut oil and chia seeds. I also had a bowl of a 'nuts and seeds' cereal with more protein powder, cacao nibs, brazil nuts, olive oil, and some other nuts (just a handful). Just a note @3PM, I'm feeling a lot better than I used to. I honestly think this is hormone related. I just feel so much less like a pussy than before. I've not only reduced sugar to practically nothing, but I've also started lifting full body every other day and been getting lots of fat and protein in my diet. Edit: I forgot to update this day in full, but I also had 500 grams of mixed veg, and I don't think much else.

*Day 7: August 19th, 2016*: Slept OK but too much. Not a fantastic start to the day, but anyway: @10AM eating my first meal of protein (blend), chia seeds, mixed nuts including brazil nuts and pine nuts, generous amount of coconut oil, and cacao nibs. @12PM I had a full body workout, mostly with isolation exercises rather than compounds, just to mix it up this week. Back to compounds next time. @3PM I'm eating eggs, protein powder and roast beef, and a couple pieces of 90% dark chocolate. I used to be vegan, but fuck it. I need cholesterol and heme iron. Also today I experienced less social anxiety and just felt like dominating people (frankly). I definitely think my test levels were way below where they should have been, and they're now recovering (negligible sugar + lifting heavy w/ far less cardio + high fat and protein). **No more sugar cravings**, now I just see sugar and unhealthy food as a way to become a pussy (mentally and physically). I'm not paying food companies to destroy my health anymore. @5.30PM I had more 90% dark chocolate with a little peanut butter and cashews.",2016-08-13 05:55:41
Six Months of Modafinil,159,fzarzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fzarzd/six_months_of_modafinil/,117,1586655228.0," For six months I’ve been using Modafinil and wanted to share my anecdotal experiences with the community.

As a baseline for understanding the effects I’m a reasonably fit male in his late 20’s and don’t take any other medicines or nootropics. My only modifiers are a cup of black coffee every morning. Behaviourally I’m a ‘good listener’ and generally keep to myself because of anxiety issues. I’ve always struggled to focus on completing any task or project because my mind wanders and is easily distracted. For a long time I’ve been struggling with ‘the haze’ where I can’t think clearly, lose motivation and generally feel dull. 

**Dosage**

I take Modafinil on an as-need basis because I want to avoid building a tolerance to the effects. Usually I will take it twice a week, Monday and Thursday, to maintain my pep. Any more regularly and I experience mild headaches and difficulty sleeping. But this schedule isn’t set in concrete and I skip days or weeks if the effects aren’t needed for productivity.

Initially I was taking 200mg of Modafinil when I wanted the boost for a day. At this amount the focus effect was counter-productive where I struggled to pull myself away from something interesting. If I took it too late in the morning, say after 8am, it would be impossible to sleep because my mind won’t slow down. 

Reducing the dosage to 100mg hit that sweet spot of ‘focused and aware’ when the boost is needed without being overwhelming. Effects last for two days with the first day experiencing heightened alertness in conjunction with side effects. The following day I’m left without side effects and a great sense of clarity and focus without the suppression of the haze. 

**Experience and Effects** 

The most noticeable effect is the lifting of the haze which was an ongoing issue. Suddenly I’m aware of everything and everyone around me as if fully waking up for the first time. I can think clearly and really focus on a task without getting distracted. Wayward thoughts are processed as if my mind is multi-threaded and I can remain focused on what I’m doing. Motivation to complete tasks and do something productive is boosted and stops me wasting my time procrastinating. Basically I feel energised, focused, clear-headed, motivated and it feels great!

These benefits have really helped to improve my sociability and interactions with people by reducing my inhibitions. Normally I’m socially anxious and now I’m able to engage others in conversation because I can finally focus wholly on what they’re saying. It feels good to shrug off confidence issues and be the chatty person I envision. During a recent successful job interview I was able to supress nerves, keep a calm face, maintain good eye contact and provide witty answers to the questions. Not to diminish my own accomplishments, but I feel Mod helped give me the edge needed to standout. 

Overall I’d say a reduction in inhibitions has been another noticeable effect. Not to the point where I’d jump in a tank of sharks or crash a party (which I sometimes do while very drunk) but where I overcome the fear of failure. For example, I’ve been getting into bouldering and would panic if I climbed too high without an easy way down. Now I can climb to the top without much regard for my mortality and therefore focus on not injuring myself and climb safely. Fear of failure has always been a major trigger for my anxiety and the suppression of that fear has helped give me the courage I need to address these issues I experience.

Other effects I don’t feel need much explanation include:

* Hypersensitivity to physical sensations. Any pre-existing pain is amplified and muscles feels very stiff. Don’t be like me and take Mod while hungover.
* Other senses, hearing, taste, smell, are all heightened. Anything triggering these sense is processed in more detail and I’m more aware of the finer details.
* Reduction in appetite. I still get hungry, but less frequently and I can distract the hunger with an activity.

**Side Effects and Unpleasantries** 

Modafinil hasn’t been a magic bullet for all my issues. I still get mentally distracted during sex losing interest very quickly; my insecurities and anxiety haven’t disappeared; when procrastination get the better of me it can completely derail my day. Without self-discipline the effects of Mod can be counter-productive to your goals.

I’ve also observed consistent side effects when using Mod (mostly) regardless of dosage size. To keep it brief I’m listing these in bullet form:

* Body can feel very cool but I’ll be sweating a lot under the arms and crotch. Checked my temperature and I don’t have a fever. Hands feel almost icy.
* Dehydration can occur if I’m not regularly drinking water. I always have a flask on hand so it’s not issue.
* When talking to people I can straight up forget what I was talking about. Like my brain outpaces what I’m saying before my voice can catch up.
* Urine develops a very strong and distinct smell. This only occurs a few hours after taking Mod and I think might be a result of the liver processing?
* Triggers a laxative like effect in my body within two hours. I am lactose intolerant, but I can eat small amounts of dairy and be fine, so I think the Mod may cause a different reaction. At higher dosages I will need to use the bathroom more regularly. 
* Consecutive daily use triggers headaches. 
* At 200mg my hands can get very shaky if they’re not engaged in an activity.
* At 200mg sleep can be difficult to achieve without a few glasses of wine to put me down.

**TLDR:** Modafinil makes me feel great by keeping me focused and motivated, while also helping to overcome issues with anxiety and fear of failing.

Strychnine: my experiences.,159,3g061a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3g061a/strychnine_my_experiences/,111,1438898060.0,"(Warning: this is one of those cases I would recommend to ‘not try at home’. My goal here is to report an experience and spread information.)

I few years ago when I was in college, I decided to mess around with strychnine, which is undoubtedly the most risky substance I’ve ever purposefully ingested. I know this was foolish, but there is a very real nootropic/physical/sexual value to this compound. 

First, I will describe my experiences, and second I will explain the rationale that led me to experiment with a known toxin..

I read about some old 20th century folk taking strychnine for athletic enhancement, aphrodisiac, and sensory enhancing properties. Naturally, as a biochem college student not afraid of strong drugs, I felt the pull of the desire to self experiment. After some initial cursory research (see below) I decided to try it.

Strychnine is found in Nux vomica.

You can get nux vomica seeds from a few Indian websites if you look around.

I first ground up some Nux Vomica seeds in a coffee grinder (these seeds are incredibly hard), and then weighed 100mg of powdered seed, which is roughly equivalent to 4mg of strychnine given that approximately 1.5-5% of the seed is alkaloid and 35-50% of the alkaloid content is strychnine. 
(**note LD50= 1-2mg/kg, so a gram of the seed would be bad news)

I got ready for a run, and then took the nux vomica.

My field of vision expanded noticeably. Every object seemed more sharply defined, with deeper shadow variations and color vividness. I also felt like I could zoom in on far off objects.
This was like going from 360p to 720p.

I became acutely aware of the cooling tactile sensation of the wind in the humid air, and exactly where the sun was hitting me. Sounds also became ‘easier’ to process, I could swear I could hear the beating of a bird’s wings above me. Also, the smell of that pizzeria across the street was particularly noticeable. It felt slightly overwhelming, this enhanced influx, and soon my spinal stiffness began to kick in. This is not a drug for ameliorating anxieties.

I have dabbled with meditation before, and this whole experience reminded me of getting into that lovely sensory meditative pocket of deep self awareness where the world seems to slow down for you to drink it in.

I began to feel jumpy, and really needed to move. So I started my run. Flying through the streets and woods was a different experience. I moved easily and everything felt bright and alive. I beat my old records and ran a mile in under 6 mins. It was a bit of an overload. As I went on I felt slightly cramped and stiff. So I headed back to my dorm, drank some kava (the recommended antidote if diazepams are not available) , and proceeded to pump out 10 pages of thesis work because if I wasn’t moving, my mind was racing, speed reading became a breeze..maybe just from the new sensory experience. I then called the girl next door to come over, and proceeded to have some amazing sex. I was much harder than usual and much more sensitive to touch, could definitely see where the aphrodisiac rumors comes from. Only problem was my whole body was somewhat stiff. 

I sampled strychnine dozens of more times with no issues, and it became a member of my noots stack (taken at smaller doses (~1mg). However, I did have a negative experience when I accidently took about 200mg of seed powder. After taking the powder I headed off to the lab to go to work, and I started to feel very anxious as I walked over. In the lab I broke out in cold sweats, started shaking uncontrollably, and ran to the bathroom to vomit. I went home and drank some kava, and proceeded to calm down. That was a bit much and haven't felt the need to try again it since. 



Here is a sloppy summary of the research I gathered before trying strychnine:

Strychnine induces generalized muscular convulsions at high doses (hence its use as a poison since ancient times), but how? Strychnine is a relatively bulky molecule compared to most other neurotransmitters (excluding peptides), it has a high binding affinity  (Kd=2-12 nM), sticking to the extracellular domain of certain glycine receptor subunit residues, thus preventing the binding of other ligands with proximal targets. Strychnine induced inhibition of the glycine receptor prevents the normal inhibitory influx of chloride ions typically elicited by glycine agonism. This allows the neuron to ignore normal postsynaptic inhibitory regulations and keep firing away. 
Strychnine, being a competitive antagonist is displaced by glycine, b-alanine, and taurine and vice versa depending on the relative concentrations and affinities. 

Inhibition of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (glycine) leads to stimulation. Makes sense.
	

After ingestion, strychnine is deposited into gastric tissue fairly quickly due to poor blood protein binding. Its XlogP (1.73) indicates it can cross the blood brain barrier, yet it is not very centrally active. This lipophilic nature leads to a broad systemic distribution. It is metabolized by CYP3A4. It begins to exert its effects 5 min- 1hour after ingestion.

The title of neurotoxin does not necessarily imply it curb-stomps neurons on contact. But we don’t want excitotoxicity… or possible peripheral neuropathy. I think the key here is in the dose. 





Specifically, which receptors/neurons?

The glycine receptor has five subunits, each of which are composed of four alpha subunit segments. The following information shows the subunits strychnine interacts with and their localization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Receptor subunit Distribution (**in rats and mice mostly)

α2
Retina, Tenia tecta, piriform cortex, infralimbic cortex, layer VI cerebral cortex, hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA4 and dentate gyrus), geniculate and supergeniculate nuclei, dorsal horn of spinal cord, neutrophils, macrophages, Neural stem progenitor cells.

α10
Pituitary, Keratinocytes, cochlear, vestibular hair cells

α1
Spinal cord, trigeminal nuclei, superior olive nucleus, nuclei of lateral lemniscus, vestibular nuclei, cuneate nucleus, gracile nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, superior colliculus, retina, sperm, spinal cord, hypothalamus, neural stem progenitor cells, cochlear nuclei, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulb

α3
spinal cord, retina, cochlea, internal granule layer of olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalmus.

α9
pituitary, glad, keratinocytes, olfactory epithelia, dorsal root ganglion neurons

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Clearly the perceived sensory ‘enhancement’ stems from strychnine’s antagonism of glyR at the olfactory, retinal, and cochlear sites. 

The diverse distribution of the glycine receptors makes localized treatment difficult. So maybe treatment with general hyperpolarization inducing/inhibitory drugs would do the trick in mitigating toxic effects.
For example: What happens when glyR is broken, as in a disease model? ..Hyperekplexia, a genetic disease characterized by pronounced tactile and acoustic sensitivity, is associated with malfunctioning glyR, and is treated with clonazepam ( a benzo)..

Possible physiological effects due to muscarinic/nicotinic acetylcholine receptor interaction:
Neutral allosteric modulation on  M1
Positive allosteric modulation on M2→ increased heart rate
Negative Allosteric modulation on M3 → vasoconstriction
Positive allosteric modulation on M4→ decreased locomotion
Negative Allosteric modulation on M5 → ?


Strychnine is an interesting compound with a long history. I don't think it really has a place in common nootropic stacks, but there are effects that I would like to see targeted.  If we could make a drug selective for the receptors responsible for the sensory and sexual enhancement, while leaving out the muscular targets, that would be AMAZING.

Author: Matthew Walker PhD

I had built up a few Audible credits from a subscription so I started browsing my favorite category and this book stood out to me due to its high ratings.  I listened to a sample and decided to take the plunge.  

So far, it has been extemely eye-opening.  The book talks about the evolutionary history of sleep, sleep differences between species, and the importance of sleep both in early human development and in adulthood.  It discusses the ramifications of not getting enough sleep, dispels myths regarding sleep, and presents research that helped us discover new insights.  The author also talks about what is not yet fully known about sleep and his personal theories that fill the gap. Here are some points that stood out to me:

* Sleep is brought on by ""sleep pressure"", or primarily a two-pronged assault caused by the dictates of the circadian rythm and the accumulation of adenosine. These two forces usually go hand-in-hand, but can become unsynced, causing the double-wammy daytime drowsiness and inability to sleep well at night.

* REM sleep is extremely important to fetal and early-child development.  Rat fetuses who had their REM sleep disrupted basically had regions of the brain stop growing.  Alcohol, even a single glass of wine drank by a pregnant woman, can potentially disrupt fetal brain development by impairing REM sleep in the womb.  Infants are also extremely sensitive to alcohol, and the tiny percentage of alchohol that makes it into the milk of breast-feeding, moderately-drinking mothers has been shown to affect the sleep of a nursing infant.

* Circadian cycles naturally shifts as a person ages.  Young children tend to fall asleep earlier than their parents, whereas teens have a sleep cycle that falls later.  Parents have a misconception that their teenagers' later sleeping habits are due strictly to poor discipline/behavior, but this is wrong and potentially harmful.  The author posits a theory that this is an evolutionary development to allow teenagers time interact to with their peer group and thus develop pertinent social skills that would be stunted under the umbrella of their parents' eyes.

* In addition, even adults have varying circadian rythms naturally, providing a biological basis for ""moring larks"" and ""night owls"", as well as a third type that is in between and is most common.  The author laments the near-ubiquitousness of an early-rise work society that disadvantages night-owls professionally and stigmatizes them socially.

* A mid-afternoon nap might be natural.  This stood out to me personally because I have been complaining to the doctor about a need to take a nap in the afternoon to feel awake and alert, no matter how much sleep I get the night before.  I went to the doctor when one of my co-workers acted like I was weird for needing an afternoon nap every day.  According to this author, this is a common human trait, and he cites research showing the uptick in health problems suffered by workers in nations where siestas are common when they stopped taking those afternoon naps. 

* Non-REM, or NREM sleep, is most important for memory consolidation, and is front-loaded at the beginning of your circadian sleep cycle.  Although you cycle between REM and NREM several times throughout the night, the NREM cycles are longer at the beginning of the circadian sleep cycle (when you *should* be asleep) and REM sees longer cycles near the end of it.  The reason I am using the term, ""circadian sleep cycle"" instead of just sleep is because your body apparently knows what phase of sleep you are supposed to be in even if you aren't asleep.  To illustrate both this and the point about memory, there is research showing that going to sleep at a normal time and waking up four hours ealier provides better memory retention than going to sleep four hours later and waking up at the normal time.  In both instances, participants in this study got the same total amount of sleep (just four hours), but the more NREM-heavy, earlier sleep resulted in better memory rentention than the REM-dominant sleep. The author says that during NREM, memories are moved from the hypothalamus (short-term storage) to the neocortex (long-term storage), which has the double effect of helping long-term memory retention and emptying the hypothalamus so it can absorb more the next day.

* Research shows that the ability to memorize drops throughout the day, even when ability to concentrate remains stable.  A nap can offset this.

* The elderly needs sleep as much as other adults, but it is assumed that they don't because they don't often get as much sleep.

Anyway, those are just a few of the points that have been covered so far, and I am only 1/3 of the way through the book.  Hopefully I got most of that stuff right.  The drawback of an audiobook is that it is harder to refer back to specific sections.  However, the narrator has a great voice and I've found the audiobook to be far more convenient. I highly recommend anyone interested in improving their sleep (it has a myriad of cognitive benefits) to at least see if their local library carries either version of this book.",2018-04-14 08:36:50

As people here generally tend to be keen to debate, I think certain issues should be addressed. Let’s see which ones you’ve encountered yourself:

**Prejudice**: Many people just don’t come here to find neutral information about a certain nootropic/drug. They want to get their preset opinion confirmed. And if nobody tells them what they want to hear, they google further, or dispute what others are saying. The longer you google, the more likely you will stumble across the correlation you were looking for. But how relevant is it?

**Misinformation**: Yes, there are some people out here that deserve respect. With their profound knowledge they enrich discussions and create value for the community. But they not only check sample size and Pearson’s r. Those people spot methodological flaws and inaccuracies in studies. And can assess their meaningfulness. But let’s be honest about it: those people are rare and most people don’t have the skill nor the time to do that. I myself would love to be one of those able to truly judge. Unfortunately I’m not. I’m just a guy with a keen interest in drugs, their mode of action and effects who knows a bit of statistics. And fortunately I can access medical papers over my University VPN. Does that make me a neuroscientist? Hell no. I probably shared just as much misinformation/interpretation with you guys as you did.

**Placebo**: I know, some people find great relief in certain nootropics. I am very happy for them. Some even describe them as life changing. Interestingly I feel like very often these hyperbolical reports happen in the first couple of weeks when a certain substance is tested. But how many people stay on these nootropics long-term because they affect them positively in a sustained manner? And why is it that so many people seem to walk from one nootropic to the next? Is it ineffectiveness? Or the need to reach even higher? 

**Selection bias**: Let’s say I google “Phenibut withdrawal”. A link leads me to a subreddit where people are discussing this issue. You automatically look for similarity. I believe most people do not try to falsify themselves. But how can you expect that the group of individuals posting there are a balanced sample? They selected themselves into a group, causing a biased sample. How many people take Phenibut but experience no withdrawal issues?

Which leads me to the next point.

**Polymedication**: I’ve seen wild combinations of medications here. Upregulating x, downregulating y, modulating z. Do you really know what other (legal or illegal) drugs the person you’re comparing yourself to is taking? How is that not skewing the experience? Thus inferences are even more difficult to make. Add in that everybody’s biochemistry is a bit different and you have the perfect recipe for disaster.

**Self-fulfilling prophecy**: I’ve tested a drug. Now I want to taper off. I google because I wanna know what to expect. And I get here where a hot debate is going on. Why are these people discussing the issue in the first place? Most often because something is/was not going as expected. They are experiencing unexpected effects. They complain, describe their never ending pain and side effects. And you transfer that on yourself. Well you don’t know that person’s story. And what they’re not telling. Is it only benzo abuse? Or are they also on narcotics? You will never know. But I do know that while reading about others sorrows/successes can give hope, it can also lead to devastating negative self-conditioning, digging the hole deeper than it truly is. 

And that leads us to the…

**Bandwagon fallacy**: When unsubstantiated information spreads its wings. A) The more people passing on a story, the more details the story loses. This is when broscience is created. B) Everybody says when you do x, y will happen. Because science. Did you check the facts and challenge the argument?

My two cents for Monday. Have a good day everyone.

We know that there are lots of our supporters and customers, who have been helping us over all this time. Unfortunately, just as the title says, we need your help now more than ever.

As of today, our website that we have been working on for more than 4 years have been completely suspended  by Shopify (the store platform we are using) without any preliminary notice. 

Here is the email we woke up to this morning:

[Shopify Account Suspension Email](https://preview.redd.it/umo1o3bkbzs41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1625c1b357027f8688b09bfa26f7fbf6deb42a78)

We have previously been in contact with their risk analysis team, who have confirmed that our store is fit for the Shopify. We  were really surprised to see this email now. We also have the confirmation from their staff that our products do not break their ToS.

As a result, we, CosmicNootropic team, **have no access to the store, orders, customers and our intellectual property (images, text, etc.)** that were on the website. Thus we cannot ship several recent orders that have been placed right before the suspension. This also means that our customers will have difficulties getting their much needed supplements.

In addition, two weeks ago we payed for 3 years of Shopify service an advance, which is a substantial amount of money for us. And Shopify did not return the payment upon suspending our account. 

We really poured our souls into CosmicNootropic and pretty much devastated by these news, especially in a time of the pandemic. Over the last 4 years we always striven to offer great service and products to our customers and provide access to much needed supplements for the ones who need them. And we really wish to continue doing this in future. 

**What can be done now**

We have already contacted the Shopify support and appealed the suspension. We are now awaiting their reply within 24-48 hours. 

For sure, we hope that the issue will be resolved in our (and also your) favor and we can continue our operation.

**UPDATE 1** (April 16, 2020)

We received a new email from Shopify that they re-enabled access to our administrative panel until April 22, 2020. This is good and this might be because of this forum. So, thank you, guys.

However, they did not specify the reason for suspension. They also did not said anything about the refund.

We will send all the remaining and paid orders but the customers will have to check for themselves as all the automatic notifications about the parcel whereabouts will be stopped in one week.

**UPDATE 2**  (April 17, 2020)

Thanks again for all the support. This is honestly priceless. At the moment we are working on moving our store to an independent hosting. As per suggestion of our customers, we will most likely use self-hosting with WooCommerce. In the meantime, we will use a temporary solution, so that you might be able to access and use the website soon enough.

**UPDATE 3**  (April 19, 2020)

So, we wanted to create a temporary solution by using Shopify. So, we copied all the information that we had on the website, installed all the necessary applications, email notifications, paid Shopify for various application to do so. Published the webstore. And... Shopify banned the website once again.

In the same time, they answered and said they have submitted a request for a refund (not sure tbh, if it means we should receive it)

Anyways, now we are actively building a new self-hosted webstore on WooCommerce. ",2020-04-16 02:31:31

I have been taking lion’s mane since May 30 for the purpose of increasing my cognitive performance, decreasing anxiety, and increasing my learning potential. I thought it might be useful to share my observations.

# My History.

Prior to this, I have not tried any nootropic except for the caffeine in my ONE cup of daily morning tea. I do not take any other supplements or medication. Throughout this experience, my mental health condition has been fairly good. Previously, I had been to therapy for anxiety, but I have 'graduated' and I had a pretty solid meditation habit (but this will deteriorate later on). My physical condition is average. I don't work out, but I don't have problems doing strenuous activities. To my knowledge, I have no health issues. I am a woman in my mid 20’s.

# My Dosing.

I take 1 capsule (500mg) of LM in the morning around 7-8:30am after breakfast. In the afternoon, I take another capsule (500mg) of LM after lunch. I use the LM capsules from Real Mushrooms.

# My observations.

**Sleep.**

I had trouble sleeping after using LM. I was aware of this side effect prior to taking LM, and I didn't think it would happen to me, because I have a regular-ish sleep schedule (sleep around 10:30-11) and would normally wake up without an alarm clock around 7am.

However, around 2-3 weeks into taking LM, I am in bed tossing and turning and drifting in and out of sleep for up to an hour before finally falling asleep. In the morning, I begin to wake up late, forcing me to set an alarm clock for 8am, and I still sleep until it rings. In total, I dedicate around 9 and a half hours to just sleeping/trying to sleep, and it feels like it’s still not enough. I remember feeling slightly groggy at the beginning of the day and repeatedly pressing the snooze button, which is something that I never do.

Initially, I took one 500mg capsule after breakfast, and another 500mg capsule after lunch around 1pm. However, I switched this to taking 2 capsules (1 gram) of LM immediately when I wake up. By taking all my LM capsules in the morning, I give my body enough time to metabolize whatever stimulant/wakefulness properties it has, so by the evening, I have no problems sleeping. I have now reverted back to my previous sleep schedule and wait for it to stabilize further.

**Cognition.**

Okay, this one was somewhat of a disappointment. LM seems to hamper my ability to recall words. I used to be the person who helps others find the words they’re looking for, but now, I have trouble finding my exact words—which is something I usually never experience. This effect on my cognition could be caused by the poor sleep quality (also courtesy of LM), so for now, I’ll wait for my sleep to stabilize and observe if I continue to experience a dip in verbal fluency.

My memory is somewhat shot. I don’t have great memory, but I also don’t have a terrible one either. Lately, it seems that I’m literally forgetting things left and right. Meetings, times, events, everything in between. It’s actually low-key freaking me out that I’m experiencing these side effects. I have always used a calendar app for day to day events, and I don’t write down my daily to-dos because I normally remember, but lately, it seems like I need to write down my to-dos or else I’ll forget.

**Neurogenesis.**

At the very beginning of dosing, I took some cognitive tests which should measure indicators of neurogenesis (this is the only ‘reasonable’ measurement method since I can’t probe myself for NGF levels). I have baseline scores of my executive functioning, memory, reaction time, and visual processing. I did not do another battery of tests at the 1-month mark since I feel like it is still too early to see the effects of neurogenesis. I will measure this at the 3-month mark.

**Learning Potential.**

Initially, the plan was to take LM while I wrote my thesis because I thought it would help me learn how to write better (in academia, your writing automatically sucks. If you know, you know). My understanding of NGF is that it helps grow new neurons, but the new neurons need to be sustained with brain intensive tasks like writing/learning new skill/ etc. Over time, you get better at the skill because you build more efficient pathways.

However, now, I realize that there’s no real way to objectively measure if there’s any improvement (no matter how big or small) in my learning ability because I’ll always be learning a different skill or a different component of a skill. There is no way to equate the different learning rates and skills because I may learn different skills at different rates. The only way to make a confident conclusion is to have a between-person comparison with a control group, which I do not have enough resources or time to do.

**Mood.**

My mood is somewhat better. Despite my stoppage of meditation, I feel relaxed and less agitated and more willing to let things go, but this is REALLY subtle/maybe imagined. Between LM and meditation, I’d say that meditation has a much more noticeable and pleasant effect on my mood.

**Dreams.**

When I first started LM, I had some pretty intense, horrific, and gory dreams. I’m a huge horror fan, so I didn’t mind it too much, but this was a very noticeable deviation from my usual bland dreams which are very rarely horrific. This went away as I neared the 1-month mark.

# Final Comments.

For now, I am not impressed, but I understand that my body might still be going through an adjustment period. I will continue to use LM, probably up to the 3-month mark. If anyone has any similar experiences as me, please let me know whether or not your symptoms improved over time!",2019-07-03 07:51:47

Aphrodisiacs enhanced social functioning and virtually eliminated stress response for me.,161,9ys6oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9ys6oi/aphrodisiacs_enhanced_social_functioning_and/,130,1542749565.0,"

I  wanted to share my experience because these seem to be two common problem being addressed in this sub. 

Edit: adding a few links and quotes. If I'd known this would have been so popular I'd have done a better job. 

TLDR l: research the side effects of aphrodisiacs, many are potent anxiolytics with zero sedation. Which in turn imporoved  my confidence and social functioning. 

Background: As a 45yo male I had an incident shortly into my nootropic journey where I couldn't get an erection until I took 3 20mg doses of Viagra. (Normally don't need and 20mg turns my penis into a steal pipe for a couple hours.)  

This lead me to research all the noots I was taking. (Side note: lots or them have negative effects on sexuality/fertility, a no-go for people attempting pregnancy like me) 

I cut out the noopept, bacopa, and the tumeric/curcumin. A week later repeat of the same incident. I was not happy. 

Researched the aphrodisiacs and decided to get a few. Been taking Mucuna w ECGC, Maca, Fenugreek, Cordeceps, Longjack, also Zinc and DHEA as well as Shilajit. (Test promotion but they are relevant) 

They worked as intended. I literally think that I am as horny as a 19yo. Morning wood will last 10-15 minutes and I want to breed with every female in spitting distance. It's insane, and a bit much honestly. Could be placebo but there is plenty of physical evidence to suggest it isn't. Please don't ask. Hahaha. 

Anyway, I noticed a few times that I had to make some calls (dealing with taxes, contentious/confrontational familial issues etc.) And also had a few instances where I thought I might be in trouble eg cop pulling behind me when I'm speeding. Also, one agrument that made me think I may have to break up a fight. Just misc stuff like that, and I noticed that I don't get the rush of chemicals we recognize as fear. 

I didn't act differently. I usually do this stuff experiencing fear. But, the fear response just doesn't come. I stay chill. 

Also, as I look back I think it has raised my level of charisma with both sexes. I feel more confident. I've also been complimented twice on my posture. I didn't dwell on this, but in retrospect it seems likely to have the same cause. 

Chemically, it seems that a reduction in cortisol and increased test are likely. 

Full disclosure. I started lifting again not too far before all this. Also, been tweaking my diet to optimize energy levels. Been MD LSD for a few months prior so also could confound it. 

I feel subjectively confident that it is the aphrodisiacs causing the changes. I am intellectually aware of how unreliable that is. 

Throwing it out there into our collective knowledge base in hopes it helps. 


NOTES: 

Mucuna:  https://examine.com/supplements/mucuna-pruriens/


See study

In chronically stressed men, prolonged ingestion of mucuna pruriens appears to be able to reduce cortisol concentrations

Maca: 
https://examine.com/supplements/maca/

Female rats subject to a forced swim test given 1g/kg Maca not that Maca possesses anti-depressant effects, reducing immobility to 76.4-87.4% of baseline

Cordeceps:
https://examine.com/supplements/cordyceps/


Consumption of 150mg/kg of a hot water extract for a week in rats is associated with a lessening of biochemical markers of stress with reduction in total cholesterol (effectively normalized to non-stress control) and attenuations of the decline in the weight of the spleen (24%), adrenal (91%), and liver (37%).[21]

Longjack: 
https://examine.com/supplements/eurycoma-longifolia-jack/


-See study

Supplementation of eurycoma in stressed persons appears to reduce subjective perceptions of stress

In an open-field elevated plus maze test, different extracts of Eurycoma Longifolia injected at 0.3g/kg prior to testing showed improvements in all measured parameters of anxiety (fecal pellets, immobility (s), squares crossed of the elevated maze) with immobility reduced to 31.2-36.3% of control depending on extract used; this was slightly less effective than the active control of Diazepam at 1mg/kg, reducing immobility to 25.9%.[29]

Fenugreek: 
https://examine.com/supplements/fenugreek/


Doesn't have proven anxiolytic effects. Analgesic effects pretty strong.

A seed extract of fenugreek (IND01) given orally to rats at 50-200mg/kg for one month following spinal nerve damage (either a partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) or a sciatic nerve crush injury (SNCI) injury) appear to reduce the hyperalgesia induced by the injuries following two weeks or supplementation, but not two days.[35] The magnitude of analgesia with 200mg/kg of IND01 was comparable to the reference of 100mg/kg pyridoxine HCl.[35]

DHEA: 
https://examine.com/supplements/dehydroepiandrosterone/

Acute supplementation of 50mg DHEA prior to exercise is able to increase free testosterone in middle-aged men and prevent the subsequent decline during high intensity training

See all 5 studies

Highly unreliable influences on cortisol, with decreases seen in studies where androgens and estrogens are also increased (with no significant influence or possibly an increase in other studies)


Zinc: 
https://examine.com/supplements/dehydroepiandrosterone/

Not a likely contributor. 

Shilajit: 
https://examine.com/supplements/shilajit/


Improves T, sometimes. 

See study

A 23.5% increase has been noted in infertile men, it is not certain if this applies to fertile men.


Also, have been taking ashwagandha. Have been taking it 2-3 times a week for a few months prior to the above. Forgot to include it as the first post was just sorta thrown out on a whim. 


It isn't likely that the Ash accounts for all the above (because the changes came months after)  but it almost certainly was a contributor.  This was  rather consequential omission. Sorry. 

My hypothesis is that the many of these, having various MOAs have been cumulative. I intend to keep this up into the future and will update if I have new data. 

I hope this helps some of you.

Isochroma is dead,159,6r0icy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6r0icy/isochroma_is_dead/,68,1501662138.0,"I found out about 45 minutes ago that Jason Lalancette, or ""Isochroma"" as he was commonly known in this community, is dead.

He killed himself last summer or so, about a year ago.

To give some context around why I'm posting this: I volunteered in another thread here in response to /u/FW900 and /u/Sherlockian_Holmes to look into Jason's whereabouts since I believe I was the closest person to him before he died. 

The last lead I had finally panned out today when I was able to get in touch with the leader of the co-op where Jason had lived. This man regretfully informed me that Jason killed himself last summer. He very kindly recounted everything he remembered about the events leading up to Jason's suicide. I wasn't able to take all the details down since, to be honest, I was mostly preoccupied with processing the news as I heard it, but the gist of it was that some time prior to last summer, the people at the co-op heard Jason talking about killing himself by jumping from a high building. He even tried to book a room on the 30th floor of some hotel with a credit card (based on the way this was told to me, I presume the card belonged to the co-op or someone there, but don't know for sure.) When that happened, the co-op reached out to Jason's case worker at social services, and the case worker took him to a group home where he could receive better care. After that, the co-op leader didn't hear anything, until he later ran into Jason's case worker last summer and asked after Jason's health. The case worker said that Jason had killed himself a month or so before.

This is all I know right now. If anyone has questions, let me know and I will do my best to answer them.

It was incredibly gentle and soft as if the CBD was telling me everything was going to be okay. There was no feeling of intoxication or impairment of thinking or judgement, just a feeling in my mind that everything was alright. I still had anxious thoughts but I could immediately put them aside and focus on what I was doing. My inner monologue was hushed to a silence and my thoughts felt very smooth and quiet. It basically felt like an antipsychotic/SSRI without the cognitive impairment or difficulty thinking. This stuff is pretty great and I plan on using it indefinitely if tolerance doesn't build. Only downsides I've noticed:  1) low duration. Only last 2-3 hours at most. 2) Low libido. Makes sex seem very unappealing (probably due to some blunting of dopamine)

I've always noticed the cyclical nature of it. It would come on pretty strong about once a year, generally starting in May-June, and then by November/December I would feel like myself again and start setting goals and being productive.

I always attributed the bouts of depression to external events - the May-June time frame, without fail, were the times when I would lose relationships, lose jobs, and generally stop feeling like doing anything.

Then - I would get depressed. But I never considered that everytime - without fail, what precipitated these external events was the fact that my cognitive function declined SHARPLY. It's like I was struck stupid. I couldn't produce work like I did before, I would sit infront of a computer staring at it and not be able to write up a paragraph. I couldn't converse like I did, I would draw literal blanks when talking to people.

I also have really really severe allergies. And now I believe the inflammatory load of allergies may be a direct contributing factor to my depression and absolute disruption of my cognitive functioning.

**Inflammation**

*  *A raft of studies suggests that chronic inflammation in the brain may be an underlying cause of problems so widespread, we've come to think of them as normal, like anxiety, fatigue, depression, and pain.* http://www.prevention.com/health/health-concerns/link-between-inflammation-pain-and-depression

* *Despite the existing knowledge regarding the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cause of sporadic forms of the disease is unknown. It has been suggested that systemic inflammation may have a role, but the exact mechanisms through which inflammatory processes influence the pathogenesis and progress of AD are not obvious. Allergy is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting more than 20% of the Western population, but the effects of allergic conditions on brain functions are largely unknown.* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22356650

* *The present data support the notion that allergy-dependent chronic peripheral inflammation modifies the brain inflammatory status, and influences phosphorylation of an AD-related protein, indicating that allergy may be yet another factor to be considered for the development and/or progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22356650

* I've found Piracetam to be **super effective** for me, even more so than most people's reports, and I believe it may be because of Piracetam's anti-inflammatory effects. *These results demonstrate that piracetam presents analgesic activity upon a variety of inflammatory stimuli by a mechanism dependent on inhibition of cytokine production and oxidative stress. Considering its safety and clinical use for cognitive function, it is possible that piracetam represents a novel perspective of analgesic.* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23474372

* I've also noticed that my cognitive function is greatly enhanced when I've eaten strict Paleo - which lowers  your overall systemic inflammation.

* I think it's interesting to note that those who experience difficult lives also exhibit greater levels of chronic inflammation. *""People who have very difficult childhoods have higher rates of chronic inflammation,""* I was adopted at 8, and that's caused major issues for me since. http://www.prevention.com/health/health-concerns/link-between-inflammation-pain-and-depression

Looking at all the evidence I'm very excited at the possibility that much of what I've always thought of as my ""mood swings"" and ""natural tendency toward depression"" are actually more symptoms of being overloaded with inflammation.

Because if it's inflammation - then it can be treated. 

Also - at the onset of every allergy season my brain feels like it STOPS FUNCTIONING. I would sit infront of my computer for hours trying to start a sentence - nothing would come. I would be in conversation with someone and literally draw blanks. I couldn't keep a conversation going. It's like my brain clicked off. Anyone else experience this in conjunction with allergies?

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

By wakefulness I mean their sense of being alert, awake, ""energized"", able to stay awake through boring tasks and so on. I keep getting exhausted when I do the boring/dull tasks which make up so much of ""productivity"". I've ruled out any health-related issue, of course.

I think one of the issues is that I've conditioned myself to expect a baseline level of ""arousal"" throughout the day, so that dull things exhaust me because my default level of stimuli-expectation is so high. Imagine you drink 8 cups of coffee every day for months or years, and then suddenly quit. You're going to be tired, right? Probably for a while. I think I did this but with my whole lifestyle, e.g. making a habit of distracting myself, using high-stimuli forums and websites, reading a lot of novel information, and so on. I've gotten accustomed (or habituated) to expecting novel information, catering to whims and interests and distraction, without practicing long hours of doing boring shit. As a result, when I experience boredom it's not just ""ah I'm so bored,"" it's ""holy shit I might fall asleep in a minute"". It's like my wakefulness has adjusted to the novelty/interest/excitement/pleasure that I made a habit of before.

But, if this is so, the question is: what's a good way to increase my wakefulness? Or alternatively, how can I quickly reset my baseline level of arousal? Probably every solution revolves around ""do the boring things while being extremely tired, and avoid high stimuli things, until you're no longer extremely tired.""

Accordingly, I was going to order more, but see that there are few (trustable) sites selling it anymore. Much of this stemmed from people taking ridiculous doses based on volume or trying to get high. 

&#x200B;

Firstly, who gets high on caffeine? If you're going to get high, please don't publicize it as being okay (particularly if you believe others may follow in your foot steps). ALWAYS weigh your powders! If you do publicize your experience, try to highlight your safety precautions and what you could have done to make it safer. It's a poor argument to believe the loops for caffine are okay because people still offer them in capsule form; we are undoubtedly surrendering autonomy and eroding our liberties. This of course doesn't just apply to caffeine.  

&#x200B;

Because of people recklessly using compounds, we are going to have to increasingly use sketchier vendors as our source of powder as the prudent vendors will get rid of a compound once it is in crosshairs (usually by FDA due to the media). This is progressively causing us to only be able to buy compounds from less prudent vendor; who wants powders form imprudent people? Now because of people being reckless, we all have to buy from less safe sources and may damage ourselves if we wish to continue the use of a compound.

&#x200B;

 Take tianeptine for example. It has done wonders for my anxiety like no other compound. Now I have to choose between remission of anxiety or buying from some rando lab in China because people ODed on it. These are huge hits to the nootropics community as it is progressively turning heads in our direction. Maybe you were indifferent toward tianeptine, but if someone can be stupid with the substance that helps you, it isn't unreasonable to think it may soon enough be dangerous to consume as no trustworthy individuals are selling it.

&#x200B;

There isn't a better time to employ these rules especially with the bill called Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues (SITSA) Act approaching.

Ultra Low-Dose Aspirin + DHA-rich Fish Oil is certainly a safer and possibly a more potent anti-inflammatory combination than Aspirin alone. (Resolvin Hypothesis) (Studies Included),153,9dljxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/9dljxc/ultra_lowdose_aspirin_dharich_fish_oil_is/,67,1536287519.0,"Hello all, 

Since my brain fog is nearly eradicated with anti-inflammatories, I have turned my attention to what i consider to be a safer alternative to conventional Aspirin treatment, or, for that matter, any traditional, normal-dose NSAID therapy.  This includes but is not limited to: Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Naproxen, Celecoxib, etc.

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the activity of COX-2 without inhibiting it directly, causing it to produce anti-inflammaotry molecules.  Aspirin and other NSAIDS, for this reason, are not recommended for long-term use.  Typical Aspirin pills contain 325mg Aspirin.

Both Fish Oil and Aspirin have seen their ups and downs as heart disease fighters.  However, Fish Oil does have considerable evidence for possesing anti-inflammatory mechanisms. DHA supplementation has been shown to [lower inflammatory markers] (https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/139/3/495/4670362) in some conditions. Aspirin has a large body of evidence concerning its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory, with even ultra-low doses (81mg every third day), (40mg every third day), which achieved [surprisingly significant effects] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11190906), considering how low of a dose was employed.


We know that Aspirin and Fish Oil together produced [more potent anti-inflammatory effects versus Aspirin alone.] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683095/)  So, here lies the heart of the matter.  Aspirin has a somewhat special ability to activate Fish Oil.  Since Fish Oil is generally one of the safest anti-inflammatories to take, Aspirins ability to activate and amplify its effects could mean large doses of Aspirin or other NSAIDS may not be needed.  Fish Oil can metabolize into a family of potent anti-inflammatories known as Resolvins.  They are employed in the body during the later stages of an inflammatory response in order to “resolve” the inflammation. Researchers have spoken of the [large degree of potency and efficacy] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3849791/) they can produce.  Aspirin amplifies this process of metabolism effectively increasing the potency of Omega-3 to reduce inflammation.


We know that Aspirin can still carry out its mechanisms while used at an Ultra-Low dose.  (40mg every THIRD day, over three days this is literally **4%** of typical once-a-day Aspirin, and only **17%** of daily Baby Aspirin therapy, which is widely considered a safe regimen by doctors.)  The dose could be tinkered with to fall into this range, with 81mg/day being the upper limit.

My hypothesis is that the anti-inflammatory effects of Aspirin can be reproduced with the addition of DHA-rich Omega 3, while using ultra-low doses of Aspirin.  This may effectively mitigate or even eradicate the bleeding/gastrointestinal risks Aspirin carries.  In my opinion, half a baby Aspirin (40.5mg) daily in conjunction with either 1 or 2 NOW-Foods DHA-500 capsules could be a legitimate, potent anti-inflammatory strategy.",2018-09-07 08:01:59

****

**TL;DR:** Dopamine modulates reward expectancy. For something to be rewarding, it has to induce a rapid spike in dopamine levels - the relative change in the level is what's rewarding. Methylphenidate keeps dopamine levels constantly elevated for many hours, and so the dopamine spikes do not feel so rewarding anymore - the dopamine level is already very high! The result is that, while the rewarding activity still increases dopamine levels, the *relative change* is less significant, since the baseline is already high (""higher standards"" for reward).

****

One of the roles of dopamine is modulation of reward expectancy. Rewards are significantly more pleasurable if they are unexpected - think a national soccer game, or gambling. Unexpected rewards induce a rapid spike in dopamine levels (phasic dopamine signalling).

Methylphenidate increases dopamine levels in the brain by inhibiting its clearance from the synapse (gap between neurons). In the short-term (minutes), this causes a dopamine spike (phasic signalling), which leads to a rewarding feeling. However, as dopamine receptors keep getting stimulated over many hours, the signalling becomes ""un""-spikey - dopamine levels are still high, but are unable to rapidly change anymore (tonic signalling).

This constantly high level of dopamine, then, causes the brain to constantly expect reward - basically, it sets a ""higher threshold"": the reward has to be *really good* to be pleasurable, since the dopamine spikes are much harder to induce. While the rewarding activity still increases dopamine levels, the *relative change* is less significant, since the baseline is already high (""higher standards"" for reward). Methylphenidate, then, decreases the sensitivity of the brain to most rewards.

However, this can be a positive thing as well: Dopamine circuits too prone to rapid spikes in dopamine levels, are much more likely to drive the person towards addictions - excessive reward from food, for instance, promotes overeating, which promotes obesity. Excessive reward from video games leads to video game addiction.

Thus, while Methylphenidate can induce a certain dysphoria/anhedonia by preventing dopamine spikes (phasic signalling), it can also restrain a too sensitive reward system, and thus might be effective against habit forming.",2019-05-05 02:41:07

Set your room temperature for optimal sleeping before resorting to sleep pills,156,5tm4qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5tm4qt/set_your_room_temperature_for_optimal_sleeping/,68,1486944500.0,"[The optimal temperature for sleeping according to the National Sleep Foundation is 60-67F](https://sleep.org/articles/temperature-for-sleep/) (lots of other good tips on their site). If your sleeping environment isn't in this range you should be making that simple adjustment before resorting to various sleep drugs and supplements. 

This has been one of the biggest changes I've made. Ever since I was a kid I always had an issue of one nostril getting blocked and never slept well due to having to constantly turn. I tried everything from strips to plugs to allergy/steroid sprays to inclining my bed to decongestant pills and sprays (not sustainable) etc but this was the bane of my existence. I have no weight/snoring/allergy issues otherwise. I was considering surgery but the possibility of empty nose syndrome was terrifying. I finally stumbled upon [this study](http://www.medpagetoday.com/primarycare/preventivecare/29077) that found cooler air temperature actually correlates with better breathing, and this correlated with the general recommended sleep temperature ranges I found after. I cranked up my AC that night down to 61 and had the best sleep I've had in years. I turn maybe once at night now. 

I also followed the recommendation about putting a heat pad under your feet. Not only does this feel amazing and make the cold tolerable but it apparently makes you go to sleep faster because it dilates your blood vessels making you cast off heat faster. Your extremities determine how cold you feel so even if you hate the cold like me the hot pad makes it not bad at all. 

This simple change is better than any supplement or drug I've taken for sleep or horizontal sinus issues and has no side effects or tolerance issues. I've eliminated a whole pile of drugs and supplements I was taking to combat bad sleep with this one adjustment. Magnesium glycinate is the only thing I'll still take occasionally because it has so many benefits. ",2017-02-13 05:38:20

What many of you may not know is that creatine may have remarkable effects on the human brain. Aside from its neuroprotective properties, creatine is a moderate stimulant and has been shown to improve alertness, wakefulness, and mental capacity in some studies. 
----------------
*Neuro-enhancing properties*---
It has  been shown to benefit those suffering from TBI (traumatic brain injuries), and can lessen the effects of sleep deprivation.   

Alertness has been shown, albeit sparingly, to increase with creatine, especially under stress and sleep deprivation.  

*How it works*-----
 
>Creatine has been confirmed to be neuroprotective against excitotoxicity at a dietary level of 1% in rats (with no protective effect against AMPA or kainate receptors).   

>Creatine appears to positively regulate the polyamine binding site of NMDA receptors, thereby increasing signaling through this receptor and the effects of agonists such as glutamate or D-aspartic acid. This is a potential mechanism for cognitive enhancement.  

>In isolated striatal cells (expressing creatine kinase), seven day incubation of 5mM creatine (maximal effective dose) appears to increase the density of GABAergic neurons and DARPP-32 (biomarker for spiny neurons[222]) with only a minor overall trend for all cells[223] and showed increased GABA uptake into these cells, as well as providing protection against oxygen and glucose deprivation

>The neuroprotective effects of creatine appear to exist in regard to dopamine biosynthesis, and the suppression of dopamine synthesis seen with some neurological toxins appears to be partially attenuated with dietary intake of creatine. The protective effect is weak to moderate in animal research, but appears to be additive with anti-inflammatories.  

>A protective effect on neurons by creatine, secondary to its ability to donate phosphate groups, exists and appears to be quite general in its protective eff

>Mitochondrial function per se appears to promote neuronal growth and proliferation, and at least in vitro, creatine is known to do the same and promote growth.  
 
>One of the studies noting a reduction in fatigue in healthy subjects given creatine (8g) for five days prior to a mathematical test noted a relative decrease in oxygenation hemoglobin in the brain and an increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin, which normally indicates a reduction in cerebral oxygenation 

>Mechanically, creatine may exert anti-depressant effects via mixed dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms. The exact mechanisms are not clear at this time.

*REMARKABLE effects on Brain Injury recovery* 
>Daily intake of creatine in rats appears to be capable of halving the effects of brain injuries. 

*Memory and Learning* 
>Acute administration of creatine (intra-cranial) appears to enhance learning from a previous stimuli, vicariously through the NDMA receptor and was enhanced via coincubation of spermidine,[212] which amplifies NMDA currents.[268] 

>In a rested state, young omnivores may experience an increase in reaction speed.[57]

>Creatine has limited potential in increasing cognition in otherwise healthy young omnivores, but it does possess a general pro-cognitive effect. 

*Possibly the most promising and exciting aspect of creatine* 
>Researchers found that 5g of creatine four times daily for a week (loading) before sleep deprivation for 12-36 hours was able to preserve cognition during complex tasks of executive function at 36 hours only, without significant influence on immediate recall or mood.[276] A similar protocol replicated the failure to improve memory and attention, but noted less reports of fatigue (24 hours) and less decline of vigor (24 hours) although other mood parameters were not measured.[2 

When considering the enormous number of purported 'nootropics' available, few can match creatine in terms of proven and promising neuro-enhancing and neuroprotective properties on the brain. 

I've noticed from personal experience that creatine, combined with caffeine, is quite a potent stack, especially upon awaking from sleep. 

I *highly* recommend supplementing with creatine monohydrate; cheap, potent, and quite beneficial to anyone looking for a cognitive boost.

"My experience fighting chronic depression/ insomnia, improving my mental performance with nootropics and other supplements. My way of giving back to Reddit.",151,6hkkbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/6hkkbp/my_experience_fighting_chronic_depression/,114,1497619239.0,"Hope this post  inspires you and helps you beat MDD and the vicious  Divorce -> MDD -> Suicide cycle as described in the following article
http://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/men-and-suicide-the-silent-epidemic. Any comment is welcome. 

Post Edit : I am in love with a wonderful women these days and no this is not a TheRedPill post. It is what I have experienced and what clinical research shows. Just google it. 

I was in NY and moved to a different country upon my wife request, with the upcoming of our second child and took a much lower paying job. She wanted more support from her parent with our children. **I didn't know anyone** in the new country . 

A year after the wife decided to separate and **divorce**, she will not admit it but it was mostly because of financial reasons. Yes most of the time women initiate the divorce and most of the time it is about money...Do your research  

And as if this was not causing enough stress,  I **lost my job** in a country that I was not a resident of ( I had a work visa) and **she sued me for child endangerment and child abuse**, just for getting custody. btw my children were 1 and 3 y old at the time of the accusation. Yes it is a classic strategy. As soon as you are accused they take the children away from you and it takes 6 months before supervised visits! Then the psychologist and the judge say that the children are with their mother , they are well taken care of...why change a status quo! This is true believe me and it happens more often than you think. 

I had to put up with the humiliating experience of **supervised visits** and two years of tribunal later when I had **used all my economies** to defend myself and pay the lawyers , when it was proven that **she lied**. She walked away with sole custody.... 


All this time I was also continuing to financially support my parents. Eventually I found a higher paying job after 6 months but immediately I realized that my mind was away and lost it because of poor performance. I couldn't concentrate anymore. I couldn't perform well at mental math where as before I used to not use calculators. Even with the higher paying job I was still living paycheck to paycheck. 

Then I **lost my Dad** after 6 months at the hospital . I used to speak to him every day over the phone. He was my closest confident.

This is when I seriously realized that despite my regular **prayers, meditation sports, studies, phone conversations with a psychologist** 
I was completely **depressed**. 

I went to a regular doctor who diagnosed me with **major depression** and wanted to prescribe regular **SSRIs**. the loneliness, humiliation, financial pressure, Ostracisation, loss of a parent, very little time with my children, job loss had taken a toll on me.  did some more research and realized that it is a common symptom among those who are wrongly accused of child abuse. 

My mother struggled almost all her life with chronic depression and I saw her go through all the different generations of anti depressants...without success. Now she has Alzheimer and had a brain stroke that make her half paralyzed. 

**I decided not to take any conventional anti depressants.** the efficacy rate of traditional anti depressants is about 30% very far from what many would consider a bulletproof solution. Also many have to use those chronically as it almost never entirely cures the depression. Once again do your own research https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4592645/

I read a lot, I study a lot, speak fluently 5 languages, I have a scientific and business background, a high IQ (Mensa) and I can understand very well nuances in most of the scientific / medical papers. I talk a lot to my friends who are Doctors.... my findings.In any case these works for me and I am confident given my studies and readings that this will work for a majority of people who are reading this thread. 

* 1 you know more with your own research on internet (ncbi mayo examine reddit....) on a particular health subject than your regular doctor or specialist. You are your best advocate even if you are in the black pitt.  It always makes me laugh when people feel the urge to specify at the end of their Reddit text that they are not a medical doctor, when describing their own experience. With the coming of Dr Watson from IBM the era of the all knowing all omnipotent doctor is over .... so do your own research...today in England a program on a tablet is doing a much better job at triaging patients at the hospital than a nurse or a Doctor. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/03/07/robots-will-soon-able-diagnose-accurately-almost-doctor/


* 2 any self respecting human already knows that the basics for fighting depression or any other medical condition are a good diet, exercise, sleep meditation prayers . I saddens me when some Redditors dismiss or brush off major depression by recommending only food exercise sleep and meditation. **It doesn t work if you have a serious depression**. That shows that they never had a major depression. It is as f they were telling you to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps! 
Here is a non trivial one : **sleep is more important than food and food is more important than exercise** . So if you have to fix one thing first ... **you have to fix sleep first** . 


* 3 Get a good sleep is not a good advice! The good advice is **how to get a good sleep**. Think about it most depressions are accompanied by various forms of insomnia. it is not just getting to sleep that is a challenge but also staying asleep. For many depressed people with anxiety the cortisol level raises in the middle of the night and they wake up and this even if they are tired to death or they have done 1 h or aerobic exercise during the day.



* 4 any sleeping pill (even the newer generation) destroys your sleep architecture so you have to avoid it at all cost. Also they don't treat the root cause. Sleep is a very complex process and scientists are still struggling to fully understand it. Sleeping pills create dependence. 



* 5 This is counter intuitive:  To break the cycle of poor sleep, lost / unproductive following day / more depression / poor sleep ....try to boost up your energy during the day with **Modafinil** early in the day every day in cycles of 5 days on 2 days off or as many days required for you to crash and have a resting sleep. For me 50mg is enough to keep me going.  the normal dosage is 100 to 200 mg. Stop this as soon as you managed to beat your insomnia. it has very little side effects ( for me none) and almost none at low dosage.  Just careful if you have  a history of stroke or high blood pressure. Even in these cases you can get by with a low dose. It keeps you up,  well awake and productive. you can function on 4 h sleep and after two or three days you will start experiencing longer sleeping time. For me 8h after years of 4 to 6 h of sleep after modafinil. **That is the single best advice I can give to conquer your sleep** . This advice is counterintuitive cause it suggest you to get even more tired (although in a more productive way) when you are already tired instead of sedating yourself to sleep....yet it works. Some other redditors have talked about it.  Another way to boost your energy that works for me. **ALCAR** 1g to 1.5 g 30 min before breakfast gives your mitochondria a boost . You get more energy as well. 

* 5Bis Combine this advice with other nootropics to bring your anxiety/ cortisol level  down during the day and the night . **100 mg of Ashwagadha KSM 66 three times a day** works great. Add to this **100 mg of some chelated (glycine, orotate...) magnesium 3 times a day and some extra  vitamin B6 and B5**.  So to conclude here *5 and 5Bis work  synergistically** Avoid Magnesium oxide as it doesn t work.  apparently 60% of Americans are magnesium deficient. **You will notice the difference immediately. It doesn't take three weeks to a month to feel something like with SSRI's**. It takes two to three days to feel a drastic difference in your sleep and energy levels.    I tried other forms of Ashwagandha in the past without success. SJW makes me feel numb! In any case any adaptogen like Ashwa or Bacopa should be included in your arsenal to combat anxiety. you can take these long term . There are no major side effects. Uridine doesn t seem to do much for me . I want o try Shilajit.



* 6 Other sleep aids that work: Listen to **subliminal messages for sleep on youtube** as a background noise in the evening when you are cleaning relaxing or watching TV . **Works much faster without effort compared to CBT and it is free**.  Einstein once said that the best things in life are free! Unfortunately when it is free people tend to doubt about its efficacy. Try it ...It is a passive thing to do when MDD drives you in the black pit.
**Black seed oil**= powerful anti inflammatory, seems to help for sleep 
**Lemon Balm extract**: gabaergic helps to fall asleep but not to stay asleep. Much better than chamomile or valerian or lavender that do nothing for me.
L Theanine relaxes me but I have to take it at least two hours before going to sleep otherwise it keeps me up....Alpha waves!
Aniracetam: same than L Theanine must be taken a couple of hours before my sleep otherwise it keeps me up
L Arginine + L Lysine = some mild vasodilator effect ...not convinced by the efficacy
Melatonin 1mg: just helps with the circadian rhythm so it is easier to fall asleep....not to stay asleep! And yes even with slow release...
Glycine= doesnt seem to do much for me
Inositol= doesn t seem to do much for me and although I haven t tried it i think that Phosphorylated serine's effect will be also very mild
**Phenibut**= Be very careful as it creates dependencies. It make me more sociable even though I don t have any crowd phobia. It is of course some form of Gaba.
**Lithium orotate** 5mg= I hear and read a lot of good things about it at low dosage but there is not much research about this form of lithium. I intend to try it at some stage.



* 7 for food ...of course a **keto diet** lowers inflammation and allows your brain to work better. But it is not a sustainable diet in the long run. I suggest to get rid of all animal products 5 to 6 days a week. Yes adopt a **vegan**  whole food plant based diet, favor lentils chickpeas broccoli seeds **sprouting**  for 5 6 or 7 days a week. That is a sustainable diet and you will see some results rapidly specifically if you add collards greens. Get rid of all processed food of course like refined sugars or wheat etc...If you feel hungry after breakfast or lunch eat **as much** bananas apples orange and nuts as you want . Yes **as much as you want!!!** You will not get fat . As long as you stick to the plant rich based vegan diet at least 5 or 6 days a week.  I eat a ton and I am slim. Yes it is science based.
Buy a good quality multivitamin such as **Life Force** that is cost efficient. Don't listen to the bullshit on many sites that advises that if you eat properly you get sufficient micronutrients from your food. The soil in many areas has been so much over exploited that the fruits and vegetables today have much less micronutrient than at the time of our parents. Again do your research. The key to a good multivitamin is of course the absorbability of the ingredients.
Eat the right fibers to feed the right bugs in your gut to send the right signal to your brain...essentially sums up to eat a lot of **Jerusalem Artichoke** among other vegetables and seeds and legumes. ""Probiotics and prebiotcs do help"". **Gut health = overall health!**. Research is just starting in this area and everyday you have new scientific papers published linking and ever extending list of non trivial illnesses such as Alzheimer Autism Crohn MDD etc ....to the microbiota. Keep a tab on the research. 
Fish oil doesn't seem to do much for me 
**Iodine** might help your thyroid function that are often disturbed by chemicals such as phthalates etc .. Haven t tried yet but on my list. Apparently Chlorella does help you get rid of heavy metals. I take it but can t tell the difference.
 Do your research



* 8 Exercise in a gym is boring as hell even with your own music , podcast etc when you are depressed unless you have **an instructor** (being coached helps to beat depression)  or you are attending a class like yoga etc.... but if you can't or are too lazy then do the **7 minute scientific exercise high intensity interval training from the comfort of your living room** you can find it on youtube....or even better **brisk walk for 30 min**. you want to bring up your heart RPM! additional benefit if you walk outside around noon to get some sun in the back of your eyes and and on your head...**Yes CoQ10 gets recycled in your brain thanks to the sun rays that cross your skull**. Even better if you can walk with a friend! Socializing helps



* 9 For a **better mood** , elevating your serotonin level and beat  depression ashwa SJW or other adaptogens don't help .**Try Simple Niacin from 1g to 4g**. Don't buy the flush free or slow release. They don t work and have side effects. It is cheap. It works much better than tryptophan or 5HTP that create serotonin syndrome in me. I take up to 2 g a day of Niacin in the morning and at noon. Beside elevating my mood it helps me also sleep better. **Listen to subliminal messages for happiness and self confidence on youtube as a background noise during the day when you are cleaning relaxing or watching TV or working**. IT is free of charge and it is effective I would also like to experiment with **methylene blue**, **Psilocybin**, (careful for those who have a schyzo running in the family) sometime in the future .I would have actually started with **Psilocybin** had I found a reliable medical source or a Dr who would prescribe it. Based on my research and not on my experience I highly recommend it.  I tried **noopept** with not much effect. 



**Summary** : beside the obvious about good food exercise and meditation,  Modafinil, Ashwagandha KSM 66 , Magnesium B6 and Niacin are my essential tools to combat my major depression disorder. It works for me. **It will boost your energy levels, your mood and lower your anxiety**. It will allow you to think deeply about the root cause of your depression and kill it. It took me 9 years of reading  trial and errors to get to this conclusion. 
**Good luck and much love to all of you**


**Update Nov 11th 2017**
I finally received my lithium orotate : 5 mg  too powerful for me, i would feel like a zombie the next day!  so I tried 2.5 . It is definitely some powerful noot. Highly recommend it to combat stress and be able to get some sleep.
**Good luck and much love to all of you**

I started taking 3000mg/day of N-Acetylcysteine five days ago and have been amazed at how well it works for me. It has rapidly alleviated my bipolar depression, increased my motivation and processing speed, improved my stress tolerance, and drastically cut down on my trichotillomania and obsessive thought patterns.

I’m just wondering why this might be working so well for me.

Short story shorter, binge drinking, cigarettes, and no exercise gave me a hell of a brain fog.

After stopping last year and trying a whole lot of stuff together (mostly anti inflammatory) I erased it along with the Anhedonia that basically accompanied my brianfog.

One thing led to another, I relapsed, and had a few months of binge drinking and smoking.

I grew some ballz a few weeks ago, quit everything again and started my regime! 

Now, I just added the Black Seed Oil to my stack and exercises, and woah. Shit Noticeably speeds up my recovery time. It's only 3rd day...


I know this is total anecdote, but I just had to share.

I take 2-3 tablespoons daily (this is actually considered a lot, if you are new to the substance try lower doses)


As a sidenote, things I do to recover/reduce inflammation:

Daily exercise of 60min minimum.
Cold bath of 1.5C core body temperature drop (14C  for 30minutes)
Hot bath of 1.5C core body remperature increase (43C for 20min)
Crushed garlic
Curcumin
Ashwaganda
Fasting for 2-3days, intermittent fasting

I do meditation daily, because all this siht would make me insane if I wouldn't ...

I also tried Aspirin but didn't notice anything  so yea... 
Also tried NoFap but I just dont feel different on a level where I know it's not placebo (unlike BSO...) although I only did it for 7-10 days a few times...

edit: as u/EternalSophism has pointed out, I'm actually not using google metrics of tablespoons. Google points out that one tablespoon is 14-15 ml, while I'm using 3-5ml doses 3x daily.",2018-11-14 03:27:44

Read the full text, you will find out that after a month, there was a statistically significant 40% increase in resting testosterone, and a -24% decrease in resting cortisol

**However**, [this study (The effects of intensive, long-term treadmill running on reproductive hormones, hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, and semen quality: a randomized controlled study.)](http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/content/200/3/259.long) shows that BOTH moderate- and high-intensity exercises decreased serum testosterone after 12 weeks of exercise. So I'm really confused now.

>  After 24 weeks of exercise, the subjects exercising with high intensity demonstrated significantly declined semen parameters compared with those exercising with moderate intensity (P=0.03). Serum T and fT began to decrease, and serum SHBG began to increase at the end of 12 weeks with both moderate- and high-intensity exercises.

Hopefully this isn't a dumb question and I'm missing some obvious variable here... Recently I've been investigating the benefits of LED light therapy, and I'm wondering if using a plant grow light might provide similar effect? All the LED therapy devices for a specific health use I've found to be super expensive, but plant lights that are on the same wavelength are magnitudes cheaper. If you go on Amazon and search ""plant grow light/bulb"", you'll find a wide array of lights that function on all the same wavelengths that the expensive devices like Joov use, but with varying intensity. Here are some screenshots of the wavelengths of light.

Additionally, I've found a lightbulb called Therabulb that is marketed for pain relief, but if you checkout the research behind some of the wavelengths it projects, you'll see all kinds of benefits from testosterone production, acne, skin healing, inflammation, and more.

Can someone enlighten me on why using a plant light and the Therabulb might not be as effective or safe as some of more expensive contraptions like Joov lights? I plan on using it on days where the sun isn't out or I'm too busy to get 30+ minutes of sunlight.

* In response to a comment from u/srz1971 on https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7rtlbv/does_folic_acidfolate_deplete_zinc_study/dt0xt8i/?context=3

* I thought i’d put the effort into writing up a sheet that has to do with Vitamin and Mineral absorption and malabsorption. If you see a ""1 2 3"" those are three studies backing up the claim i'm referring to. I see alot of threads in here about taking vitamins and minerals with no mention of vitamins or minerals that may be competitive or synergistic to absorption.  We need to make an effort to keep ourselves and newcomers informed so we don't end up mixing things that shouldn't be mixed.    For example, one of the more harmful things I list below is Birth Control/Oral Contraceptives, these damned things shouldn't even be mixed with most nootropics and I feel we should mention things like that in our future posts to prevent people from damaging themselves.
People posting Magnesium L-Threonate threads with no mention of Calcium and Zinc Supplementation, holy shit guys, are you trying to hurt yourself and others?

* Forgive me if this should be in another subreddit since it has to do more with nutrition than the nootropic effects of nutritional supplements. But, it should cover a handful of FAQ's about Vitamin and Mineral Absorption. 


* I’ll start with the common things that deplete Vitamins and minerals, and a small chart in regards to Vitamin and Mineral balances. I’ll be pulling information from this page, http://divinehealthfromtheinsideout.com/2012/05/factors-that-deplete-minerals-from-the-body
, and citing any studies (Mostly short Pubmed articles) to back up the claims made in the aforementioned blog.


**Antacids & Acid blockers** – deplete calcium, but often people are unaware as testing is done on blood levels and only 1% of the calcium in the body is in the blood. This doesn’t indicate the loss in the bones/tissues. Antacids/Acid Blockers contain [aluminum hydroxide which prevents the absorption of calcium from the intestinal tract.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3886758)”


**Low Stomach Acid/Hypochlorhydria** – the body needs appropriate stomach acid in order to break down minerals, namely calcium. Also, low stomach acid can be a [sign of low zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3575353) because zinc is needed in the body to help produce stomach acid.
There’s several studies around suggesting that proper stomach acid levels are one of the first steps in proper mineral absorption. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1894892) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2543192) [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC425063/)


**Birth Control Pills** – deplete magnesium and zinc, along with numerous other vitamins. And since they have a direct impact on our hormones this also plays with our ability to get the minerals needed. They cause excess copper in the body, which can be toxic, this is why zinc becomes depleted as these two minerals are antagonistic to each other.
According to a few studies [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852908) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7001015)  [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21967158) , Birth control pills can cause a huge imbalance when it comes to your nutritional health. 


**Coffee** – calcium/magnesium are lost in our urine with coffee. It’s a diuretic. You will be losing potassium and sodium as well. The same goes for caffeine in general.  
This one’s a bit dodgy, because the study that initiated the belief behind it involved [injecting caffeine into rats](https://watermark.silverchair.com/jn1160020273.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAagwggGkBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGVMIIBkQIBADCCAYoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdeH6q60Q6bycYUlXAgEQgIIBW1WICYPkL-I0mmCRz3zLQyDVKnZxWxH0GJ5LV5uE-2NcnlNoH0x-Sof1w4qwrmwef9-Ua0sauIf9WQxgNeHItfCfLnyrG4aMrnzpM6l1U9JsLWwg3E82jBwuJttk39hwgrLmMI2-twuF0RzYJA4MRCgruhcrHcSP140K7CCvubuwumjNfDwWWkZwcAliqPDtcGgQdHnP2azcJJWWKtx1QN_yjrHEyhRXPQkx_jKAg1bIH6S4XMHLX_FdfzQut8_Uxo4lEtLgeprENiPavaOIqIIWXwat0x1bai9yJsoUWRuT3GbIqOAkUo1oeeZamvfQDrdjxVsdvxxFWrqxIseWE5FyhYpFOVdhSp0Xmj9jKK3wR0kow1CGlK4IDCBW1ydblbZPNnqb4NRzHZkPxpmQUYKCXZjm3O7m8yMNF9DDgIrplUwAvGKAQKoAqDyieSEUZWTL-IhejUrWBaDG)  rather than study it through [dietary absorption.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531784801323). Take this one with a grain of salt, I've read studies suggesting that although there's an elevation of magnesium in urine it doesn't cause a nutritional imbalance when it's excreted or secreted more frequently.



**Alcohol**-  speeds up the excretion of [magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11569488) through the kidneys. It can also deplete, calcium, [zinc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6393807), iron, manganese, [potassium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12189007) and chromium.


**Sugar**– for every molecule of sugar our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it. Insulin surges use up our zinc. Sugar also depletes magnesium, potassium and robs your bones of minerals in general. A high sugar diet results in increased losses of chromium through the urine.


I’m just going to link this [extra long pubmed article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452236/) it has about 74 references backing up the study. You’ve gotta have a healthy balance of fats and sugars in your diet to maintain bone health.


**Excess Insulin**– causes calcium to be retained by the body through re-absorption by the kidneys.
    [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC333158/) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2362396/) 
-- #2 is the especially long article, worth a read.
 
**Hyperthyroidism**– causes increased calcium losses and increased calcium resorption from the bone. Creates the need for more magnesium. Often more copper is needed, along with iodine. Perhaps it would be better stated that deficiencies of selenium play a role in low thyroid hormone production
Not gonna touch this one, thyroid issues are complex and it’s much better to consult a physician if you suspect that you’re hypo or hyper.
 
 
**Stress**– depletes magnesium. 
Magnesium regulates cortisol levels, it’s a pretty straight forward one, not gonna touch it.


**Excess Grains**– [phytic acid binds with the minerals in the intestine and blocks absorption, causing them to be excreted unused.] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325021/)
 
**Oxalates**– oxalic acid is a substance which binds with calcium in the intestinal tract and actually prevents calcium absorption. (oxalates are found in spinach, beet greens, rhubarb and chard)
 


* I think that’s enough to sum up the first topic, you can read more and do your own reading using the divinehealth blog as a reference. I didn’t even touch down on vitamins yet and I could even say there’s information missing above; take [coffee](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18606630) for instance. Coffee, (and possibly caffeine), has observably been known to reduce plasma B vitamin concentrations.
    I’m not going to touch down on vitamins in the same way as the above. I’d rather get right into a chart or list of absorption chains.
I was going to put together a web chart or something in photoshop and remembered I had these saved on an old hard drive 


[Vitamin and Mineral Synergies](https://i.imgur.com/7dAHnO3.jpg)  This one seems a bit out-dated. We call Vitamin F, ""Essential Fatty Acids"" now.


And another [two useful ones](https://imgur.com/a/Sl1fp)


[The Simplest yet cleanest ones](https://imgur.com/a/9Pkzz)  I like this, but it's missing some links between dependencies. For example, Iron absorption depends on Vitamin B12, Folate, Vitamin C, and Zinc.


* In the future I'm thinking I'll create a more visually appealing infographic than these bloody things. They're all really ugly and cluttered. This will include  infographics showing synergies between proper nutrional balancing and commonly used noots. Any existing infographics would be an excellent contribution and I can add it to this post in the future.


* I'd love to turn this into a bit of a megathread/guide for anyone to use for future reference. If you have any requests, or suggestions, or things to add it'd be much appreciated. Feel free to message me at any moment, or comment below.

I wanted to see more from myself that I knew I had in me, and it was this pursuit that made me take a deeper look at my physiological health.

I've had minor to severe brain fog throughout my life but never thought that it was too abnormal. I tried modafinil and it was an amazing precursor to the world of nootropics, but i always felt like it wasn't enough.

To make a long story short, I've discovered that I have adrenal fatigue (edit: low cortisol), deficiencies in a lot of trace minerals, b12, D, iron, and other things that both my primary care physician and my endocrinologist failed to look into, despite being predisposed to these issues as a result from having hashimotos thyroiditis, and despite doing numerous blood tests that checked for literally everything else. Not only that, I was losing my hair rapidly, sleeping poorly, irritable, etc etc and the list goes on. It was disheartening to hear that I was on the proper treatment when I wasn't feeling better, and even more disheartening to realize that almost all endocrinologists simply treat hashimotos with t4, despite its well known issues

I used a combination of 23andme and Genetic genie to uncover a lot of the underlying causes (such as my generic mutation MTHFR) of my fatigue and it made me realize that my current treatment was completely inadequate.

My research also lead me to believe that these deficiencies also caused greater sensitivity to allergens, which explained why my allergies were getting progressively worse over the years.

After months of research and basically guiding my own testing and prescription protocols with my doctor, I've finally developed a plan that will help me treat all of the above and hopefully put my hashimotos into remission. More importantly my mental acuity has skyrocketed and everything else with my health is slowly falling into place.

If I knew about this mutation a long time ago I may have been able to prevent my autoimmune dysfunctions from taking over my life or at least mitigate them to a large degree. The truth is, anyone with these mutations is at risk for developing a disorder, and all it takes are a few triggers (such as antibiotic use and vitamin/ mineral deficiencies).

I realized that nootropics should be approached first with a thorough understanding of your body before you take experimental supplements. It has really made a world of difference for me, so much so that I started compiling my research into a comprehensive resource for others to benefit from eventually.

So anyway, thanks for being a community that encouraged the pursuit of better understanding our potential, it was this motivation that helped me turn things around :)",2015-09-26 10:10:42
A year of noots - my thoughts on the things I've tried,146,3gglpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3gglpf/a_year_of_noots_my_thoughts_on_the_things_ive/,82,1439241043.0,"Hey fellow lab rats! I just realized that last month was a year since I bought my first nootropic - adrafinil from NootropicsDepot. Since then I've been going ham on this and buying way too many things to try and be disappointed by. People usually seem interested when these sorts of things get posted, so I figured I'd throw my reviews out there to help people along.

Keep in mind that YMMV and everybody is different. I'm clearly a non-responder to some of the more popular things people love to go on about here so don't take my word on anything as gospel.

Anyways, here we go: everything I've tried within the last year!

- **Adrafinil**  
My first noot! While adrafinil was interesting at the start, after a few days of use it began to really drop off in efficacy and it started to give me more headaches and more jittery stimulation instead of smooth wakefulness. In the end I'm not sure I'd want to bother again.

- **L-Theanine**  
Interesting. A lot of people report that this just magically fixes their entire life somehow - anxiety gone, more relaxed and social.. not for me. L-Theanine doesn't seem to really do anything without caffeine for me. With a 1:2 ratio for caffeine:L-Theanine, I'm a lot less jittery and anxious with lower doses of caffeine. I usually take one 200mg pill with my coffee in the morning. I've noticed that higher amounts such as 200mg caffeine and 400mg L-Theanine don't really seem to have much of an effect on me. No idea why. I still enjoy it when it works.

- **Modafinil**  
I know the afinils aren't always considered nootropics by some, but I'm going by the extremely casual ""anything used to improve cognition"" definition here. Modafinil is *really* interesting to me. I have chronic fatigue due to sleeping (extremely) poorly for years and years - likely due to the shitload of drugs I abused when I was a teenager. I still sleep like shit. I've tried loads of things to help but nothing seems to. Luckily, I got some modafinil and realized that if I can't sleep well, I can at least still function like a normal person with this stuff. A lot of people think this is some study drug that acts like ritalin - do not use it if that is what you are expecting. You will be disappointed. Modafinil does nothing more than make me *forget* that I'm tired. I don't know how else to explain it - when I use modafinil, the tired feeling gets sent to the back of my mind and I completely forget about it. I'm awake and able to function. If I stop and remember that I'm tired, I'll yawn and feel exhausted all of a sudden until I get back to what I was doing. It's very strange. I love it to daeth. I've been using moda/armoda for 10 months nearly every day. 

- **Armodafinil**  
The supposedly stronger and ""smoother"" version of modafinil. I've been using this for seven out of the ten months I've used *afinils. I find armoda even better in that it feels significantly less subtle in that it does provide some stimulant-like effects for me. It also seems to last a good bit longer but doesn't interfere with my sleep in any way. Tolerance is definitely an issue so after like 8 months of continual daily usage, I recently stopped using afinils on the weekends and try to use caffeine instead when I can on the weekdays. Just a few days off every now and then have made a huge difference. 

- **Racetams**  
The racetams are loved by just about everybody here so I was definitely intrigued. I'm just going to throw most of them in to this one spot because they all had nearly no effect on me. Off the top of my head, I tried aniracetam, piracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam and probably one or two more. I tried the recommended dosages several times, the lower dosages, the really high megadoses that people rave about on occasion, and I even tried some of them for weeks at a time at the recommended dosage. On the megadoses I occasionally noticed feeling really in to the music I'd be listening to or a very slight increase in attentiveness/desire to get things done. So slight that I'm really not sure if it was just noise or if was the racetams. These just didn't do it for me, plain and simple. Except for..

- **Phenylpiracetam**  
This is the only one I noticed a significant change with. If I took it while fairly awake and alert, I'd feel a lot more physically.. antsy? Technical term! I just noticed it made me want to get up and work out. It didn't give me any stimulation as far as I could tell. I feel like it was a combo of anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects along with just feeling like I had way more stamina. I would be sitting at my desk and want to go for a run or do my workout routine or something even though I had just worked out shortly before that. I really liked it, but the tolerance was pretty heavy. Taking it two days in a row meant I probably wouldn't notice it. I haven't tried any since the first time I purchased some, but I'd like to order some again soon. I see why its a banned substance for athletes now.

- **Tianeptine sodium**  
Tianeptine was honestly life-changing for me at first. I took Zoloft for a while maybe three years back which really pulled me out of my depression enough to allow me to get things sorted out in my life. I was able to get off of it and continue living like normal for a while. Once the feeling hit me again, I reached out to finally try tianeptine. The first time I took it was ridiculous. People say its subtle but subtle was the last thing it was that first time I took it - I was happy, smiling, positive, and extremely kind and thoughtful.. for like two hours. This stuff needs redosed so often that its a pain in the ass. And the worst part is it was so inconsistent for me - I took it when needed which was maybe once a week or so. One day it'd work perfectly and then another it didn't do shit. I tend to be really weirdly moody throughout the average day - I'll be so happy and then a bit later everything sets me off. Sometimes to the point where my girlfriend trying to give me a kiss irritates me :( I have no idea why but tianeptine sodium fixed that completely for the short amount of time it would work. Zoloft made me content and non-emotional. Tianeptine allowed me feel a full-range emotions, including happiness. Lots of it, too. 

- **Tianeptine sulfate**  
I was in love with this when it was released by Ceretropic. It lasted the entire day for me and was much smoother - no ""whoa okay its working"" or ""oh there it goes, gotta redose"". Just a nice smooth effect for almost the whole day. However, I noticed that after some time the mood-changing effects I had with the sodium faded. I'm not saying this is going to happen to all sulfate users or that this is an actual thing that was happening and not just something with my body, but it definitely happened - the mood stabilizing turned in to more of a ""yeah I guess I'm happy"" and sometimes ""yeah, happily fucking irritated"". I was no longer feeling very positive, just in a slightly better mood. I'm currently going back to trying the sodium later today to see if its worth it. The price for the sulfate also killed it for me. I hate spending money.

- **Glycine**  
I took glycine every night for a while for the potential sleep quality improvement that many people would talk about with it. I was excited at the idea of improved sleep quality but noticed absolutely no differences in any aspect of my sleep with it at all kinds of different dosages. I use the 'Sleep Cycle' iOS app and have for years. I know it isn't exactly super scientific and accurate, but I can also say I saw no difference in there either.

- **Magnesium**  
This stuff actually helped my sleep! Exciting. about 1g or so of the Doctor's Best Magnesium Chelate would make me feel very relaxed to the point where I was able to lay down in bed and just drift off after a few minutes. However it also made me have to shit like never before. I'm waiting on some other stuff I ordered to get here that supposedly doesn't have this same effect. 

- **Rhodiola rosea**  
The first time I took this, I noticed an increase in energy, mood, cognitive functioning, etc. I just seemed a lot brighter. I tried it again the next day and barely noticed a difference. I've tried cycling it and taking it sporadically and taking it daily but it seems really unreliable for me. I still take it on occasion hoping that it'll have that same effect again but eh. 

- **Ashwagandha**  
Same thing with Rhodiola rosea - works *really well*. Sometimes. Seemed to have more energy, better mood, less anxiety, etc - adaptogens in general seem to work great but only 1/10 of the times I take them. Shame.  I've heard others say similar things about them, but they also say they just cycle them and they're fine after that.

- **Semax**  
I use the nasal sprays for Semax and they're pretty nice - Semax and NA Semax both gave me a very nice focus and alertness that lasted seemingly all day and were very smooth coming on/off. NA Semax was much stronger. I've also tried NA Semax Amidate but barely noticed anything from it personally. I really like NA Semax in combination with my armodafinil if I need to do something that requires me to focus and work straight through it. 

- **Hydrafinil**  
Wasn't a fan. Not much to say. Felt a lot like adrafinil in that it was stimulating more than I wanted and gave me headaches sometimes. I especially noticed the stimulation with this one because I could feel my heart going nuts. I know it isn't *really* meant to be an *afinil and it just promotes wakefulness, but I wasn't a huge fan.

- **Caffeine/NALT Solution**  
Love it! This is what I use on the days I don't take armodafinil if I'm especially out of it in the morning. I don't know what it is about it, but it feels like what I expected caffeine and L-theanine to feel like. Very smooth stimulation - not jittery or over-stimulating. The taste fucking slays me though, oh my god. I've also thrown in various flavorings I use for making e-juice (they're all in PG) to see if I could get the taste better without ruining the solution. The solution has yet to be ruined as far as I can tell but fuuuck the taste just never changes. It should say something though that I'm willing to keep using it despite the taste making me suicidal. MYASD was right on the money with this stuff. I can't wait for that green apple flavored one he was talking about a while back. 

- **Super B12**  
I like this stuff. I don't really know what its supposed to do or if I'm somebody who should be taking it but I feel like anytime I take it, I have a little more energy for the day. The taste is really ""cherry medicine"" flavor which I'm not big on but it doesn't make me want to die or anything. 

- **Phenibut**  
I was pretty excited to try phenibut recently. I'd heard sooo many things about it and despite it being high risk - destroys anxiety, eliminates any social phobias, and it even helps sleep like *a ton*. So I've tried it maybe three times now since I got it - I have a very addictive personality. I have no worries about that part yet. I've made sure to take it like a week apart each time. I've been using doses around ~500mg. Usually I'll take it a few hours before bed to try and sleep. It seems to help me feel more relaxed but I don't notice a whole lot else. I do usually get a warm, physical euphoria maybe an hour or so after I take it that lasts for a pretty short period. Socially I don't feel much different but I really don't have any issues being social in the first place. I like it, but I'm not sure I get the obsession some people have with it. Again, probably just something with my brain but if I had to rate it, I'd probably say ""eh it's pretty good I guess"". 

- **Creatine**  
Creatine is so cool. I see no reason for people not to take it. I take it for workouts and I've noticed my brain fog seems to disappear when I take it. I never made the connection until I saw that article earlier this year that talked about creatine's effect on cognition. Really great stuff. Just wish there was an easier way to take it than just tossing 5g of dense powder down my throat and choking it down with water. 

- **Melatonin**  
I don't know if this counts, but I'm gonna count it. I've been told by every doctor since I was younger to ""try melatonin"" instead of anything that would actually help my sleeping problem. Well I did try it. A shit load. I tried literally every possible dose from 100mcg - 10mg. At any dose I tend to feel a bit down the next day and have some trouble waking up. The only doses that really do anything for me without making me miserable the next day are 300-900mcg. Anything above that is just shit for me.

- **Flmodafinil**  
Really cool stuff. I feel like this is just like armodafinil but much more natural feeling. One thing about the afinils is when you use them, you know you're using them. There's this weird physical feeling I'll get in my chest with them that says ""oh it's kicked in!"" and stays there for a while. I don't get that with flmodafinil. I've only gotten to try it twice now but I really like it so far. Dosage is ~200mg.

- **Bromantane**  
I really like it but it makes me a little nervous. It has properties of a stim and is anxiolytic. It's very stimmy but not in a ""gotta go fast"" way. I don't like the studies they did on animals where it caused issues with the offspring or the theory that it could lead to an increased risk of Alzheimer's, but it's interesting.


This is all off the top of my head. There are definitely other things I've tried that I can't recall right this second. I'll add them as soon as I think of them. 

Hope this is interesting/useful to somebody out there. Any questions, ask away!

**tl;dr** - Most things are either total placebo or just way too subtle to notice a difference. Highly recommend tianeptine, armodafinil, NA Semax, creatine, and Ceretropic's Caffeine/NALT solution. Maybe phenibut and maybe phenylpiracetam. Adaptogens are interesting but unreliable.",2015-08-11 02:40:43

"Brain plasticity, critical periods, and receptor regrowth",145,a8vrur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/a8vrur/brain_plasticity_critical_periods_and_receptor/,38,1545609992.0,"A recent study showed that folks with ADHD have up to 50% fewer choline receptors in their brains [1]. Another study showed that stressed pregnant mothers rear children with a greater number of mental issues like ADHD, OCD, anxiety, and memory deficits [2]. Choline supplements either in the mother or postnatally seem to offset the effects of this stress [3, 4], but in adults only partially.

My question is whether or not there’s any known way to increase neuroreceptor density of any sort (in this case, for choline) in adults. It seems like even up to adolescence, supplementation of choline greatly reduces any deficits (presumably choline and it’s receptors are shaping the brain during a critical period). What might be able to do this in adulthood? 

Totally speculative, but if pan-hdac inhibitors like valporic acid can reopen critical periods in the brain, could they also reopen the window for choline to repair a brain damaged by prenatal stress?

I have been in the nootropics game for around two years-ish. Thousands of dollars and tens of hours have been spent on products and research. I have a very extensive daily stack that's focused on both short-term and long-term improvements.

Anyways, have you ever thought that the money spent and time used researching have been a waste? Do you think that the effects felt have been either largely exaggerated or even made up? 

I am not talking about the supplements that have been largely researched and objectively confirmed, such as fish oil, and certain vitamins/minerals. I am talking about basically anything and everything else that's considered a nootropic that is only ""confirmed"" anecdotally.

Important Safety Considerations,150,72wpja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/72wpja/important_safety_considerations/,24,1506588940.0,"I've been refining my stack for a long time now, and one thing I've increasingly grown aware and have become very concerned about is the potential for some unknown, but serious consequences to taking large supplement stacks, particularly those incorporating lots of herbal or fungal supplements. So I figured I'd make a post to help guide your research in larger/long-term stacks.

**A) Beware of liver enzyme effects.** So many common nootropic herbs interact with hepatic enzymes, typically in an inhibitory manner (though inducing can also be harmful). Piperine is used to enhance absorption but this also means enhancing the absorption of the range of compounds the target enzyme is in charge of metabolizing. This could have consequences such as increasing the amount of time you are exposed to certain harmful byproducts of metabolism or absorbed from the environment. It also increases intestinal permeability both good and bad.

You must take particular care when you are also on medication affected by the enzymes affected by your supplement stack.

**B) Beware of too much antioxidants.** While oxidation plays a role in the mutation process of DNA leading to cancer, cancer cells are in fact also extremely vulnerable to oxidation. The very nature of cancer is bypassing certain limits that not only stop a cell from reproducing rapidly, but that also detect when a cell has been damaged. So in order for cancer to be aggressive it also makes itself vulnerable to oxidation by bypassing the checks against excessive damage from it (healthy cells that are working for the benefit of the organism will suicide when they've become too damaged to be beneficial to the organism, this is called apoptosis). 

The best way to prevent and treat cancer is to maintain a balance between a systemic oxidative state and natural antioxidant mechanisms that operate in a controlled, targeted manner. An example of this is how saunas are beneficial to health. Increasing the body temperature increases the rate of oxidation (as increased temperature increases the vulnerability of organic matter to be oxidized). This is actually beneficial as long as you don't overdo it, because it kills off the weakest (and hence lowest functioning) cells or vulnerable cancer cells, while the strong cells trigger mechanisms that cleanup damage caused by the heat, and often go beyond and clean up other damage accumulated in the cell (this process is called ""autophagy"" in biology). Exercise has similar effects (less from temperature, but more from increased energy demand) and hence also is known for being beneficial in preventing cancer, and in treating it (not on it's own obviously, but as an adjuvant).

These effects can be partially mitigated by excessive antioxidant consumption, though it also depends greatly on the type of antioxidant supplement. Flooding the body with excessive Vitamin A or E has been discovered to be moderately carcinogenic, while Vitamin C does not seem to be harmful except in perhaps extremely (unfeasibly) large oral dose. This is because A and E are both fat-soluble and accumulate while C is not and is mostly (some is taken up by special rate-limited transporters for long term usage) flushed out within hours. Blueberries and their extract seems to be fairly safe and even anti-cancer. Spirulina seems to modulate the body's innate anti-oxidant system as does curcumin so both are fairly safe.

But even with these more moderate compounds, I'd be wary of stacking too many and over-activating the body's antioxidant mechanisms, perhaps canceling the anti-cancer benefits of exercise and heat stress, and even shielding cancer from immune destruction (which frequently relies on oxidative attack). I would evaluate compounds *very* carefully if you're going to stack more than 2 sharing a mechanism of antioxidant action. An example of a likely safe stack would be vitamin c 500 mg 2x daily, curcumin, and 2000-4000 IU Vitamin A supplement (as beta-carotene, not the common palmitic acid which promotes cancer metastasis).

**C) Beware of compounds affecting heart rhythm.** This is of particular concern for any compounds that affect ion channels (calcium, potassium, sodium), and of fair concern to drugs that effect norepinephrine, dopamine or particularly serotonin 5HT-2B which can cause fibrosis in the heart.

When stacking more than a few herbal supplements, I would be cautious about researching whether any are associated with arrhythmia, QT-prolongation, tachycardia, bradycardia, etc. I would very carefully consider whether it's worth taking more than 5 different herbs, I particularly wonder about the danger of some stacks I've heard of like Kurzweil's famed 250 supplements.

The part that concerns me is that the right combination of a ton of compounds could most definitely cause heart arrhythmia even in healthy individuals, through excessive modulation of ion channels or neurotransmitters regulating heart rhythm. For this reason I advocate small, focused stacks. If you want, shift between stacks, but I don't recommend trying to fix optimize everything at once.

**D) Don't attempt to significantly increase LTP/neural excitation via strong AMPA/NMDA activation (i.e Sunifiram/Unifiram and some other racetams).** Most people, particularly young individuals already have a ratio of excitation/inhibition that is fairly close to optimal, and in fact many AMPA or NMDAergics can easily push that ratio towards excessive excitation, particularly if you were unlucky enough to have a traumatic event occur (i.e stroke/haemhorage, or say a head injury from a fall or blow) as they would exacerbate damage from the event. In addition, people with ADHD/Bipolar/depression already have an imbalance of excitation to inhibition, and so could be particularly vulnerable to a worsening of symptoms (that should go away but still), or damage.

For this reason I advocate stacks that focus on shoring up defences against excitotoxicity (magnesium, micro-dose lithium aspartate, creatine, taurine, spirulina, etc) even if you aren't taking AMPA/NMDA inducing supplements.

Supplements that moderate increase LTP should be fine, but the key is that the mechanism is modulatory and that it doesn't just bluntly increase LTP non-discriminately. Piracetam is safe in this regard, aniracetam is moderately safe though shouldn't be combined with any other AMPA increasing compound, Nicotine selectively enhances LTP pathways and so isn't harmful if you don't count the addictive effects (though they are less intense when nicotine is taken on it's own compared to as tobacco with all of the other compounds in the leaf).

**E) Be careful when taking multiple supplements increasing growth factors of any sort (be it vascular, neural, etc).** This includes BDNF, IGF, NGF, VEGF, FGF, etc. While a small to moderate increase in the activity of these growth factors seems to be increasingly beneficial with age, there are also drawbacks to increasing them that must be considered, especially when significantly increasing them.

Cancer is promoted by growth factors. They increase cancer cell survival and ability to metastasize. So if you get a neural cancer, BDNF boosting is going to boost it up, and yes, if you were overdoing it could play a role in the cancers outcome once it's diagnosed. Vascular growth enhancers increase the ability of all cancers to metastasize (as vein permeation of tumor masses allows for a much more cells to break off and float into the blood stream)

Honestly, it's my opinion that unless you are pursuing treatment for a condition known to be associated with a deficit of growth factors or are looking to counteract the age-associated decrease of growth factors (in which case you should ONLY take them if you're going to induce stress on your body via exercise to counteract the promotion of growth of corrupted cells), you should not look to deliberately increase growth factors. I wouldn't go as far as saying don't take supplements that boost them, but be very careful not to overdo it.

**F) Watch out for emergency warning signs of a severe immune reaction to a new herbal supplement/drug (non-nutrient).** There are conditions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis that can occur in reaction to certain drugs depending on the person, and you're risk of developing it increases the more supplements you take. It causes your skin to basically be eaten away by your own immune system. Yay!

Warning signs are fever, sore throat, a cough, a burning sensation in the eyes. If you get one of these symptoms shortly after starting a new non-nutrient supplement (i.e herbal or drug), immediately cease taking it and go to a hospital if more symptoms of SJS/TENS develop or if you are otherwise concerned that it's not a coincidental flu.

People with autoimmune disorders particularly Lupus are more susceptible to SJS/TENS.

Modafinil has been associated with SJS/TENS (rare adverse effect).",2017-09-28 14:25:40

My experience quitting caffeine cold turkey(10 weeks),149,3wf4yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/3wf4yt/my_experience_quitting_caffeine_cold_turkey10/,67,1449892911.0,"I went off of caffeine cold turkey 10 weeks ago. No coffee, no teas, no chocolate, nothing at all that contained even 1mg of caffeine.

My reasons for quitting: 

* I felt terrible and tired all the time. I felt tired no matter how long I'd slept.
* I couldn't function without caffeine.
* I started experiencing extreme anxiety - to the point that it became difficult to have conversations.
* My emotional state deteriorated to the point of depression.
* I was consuming 300-500mg caffeine/day.

With the way I was feeling I knew something needed to change. My productivity was awful(maybe 1-2 productive hours a day). My outlook was very negative. I was slipping into depression further everyday. Caffeine was the main culprit.

**Benefits I've observed:**

* Sleep! Holy gods. No more racing thoughts in the evenings. No more waking up feeling exhausted.

* Anxiety and social anxiety - gone. Back to my normal self. 

* Depression - much improved, still not back 100% but much better than I was at the point I stopped using caffeine.

* Focus - It's a tie between sleep and focus on what the most dramatic improvement has been. Previously I would find it hard to stay on-task for even 10 minutes. Now I can stay on-task for 60 minute blocks in the mornings(which get shorter as the day goes on).

**The timeline of experiences:**

* **Week 1-** Awful. Headaches. Super sluggish. Very difficult to maintain conversations. Needed a nap every 2-3 hours. Depression worsened. Anxiety still present.

* **Week 2-** No more headaches. Still very sluggish. Conversations slightly easier, brain doesn't feel quite as stupid. Still need naps in the day to function. 

* **Week 3-** Less sluggish. I feel less slow and stupid. Still no motivation to do anything. Getting out of bed is really difficult. Depression is worsening. Anxiety is easing. Less need for naps and I have a few snatches of feeling ""normal."" It feels like recovering from a long illness.

* **Week 4-6** Feeling more normal. I can make it through the days without a nap now. Still very unmotivated. I can wake up in the morning feeling decently rested but the motivation to get out and do anything is not there. This lack of motivation is leading into more depression as I am letting projects slide.

* **Week 7-10** Feel mostly normal. Mornings are still the most difficult. Past 4pm I feel energized, awake, and excited for life. Still depressed in the mornings.

**Some Lessons**

* Consistent high dose caffeine masks other underlying contributors to our energy and motivation. Like sleep, nutrition, exercise, and our natural circadian rhythm.

* Movement is vital. 20 minutes of aerobic exercise gives me a nice caffeine-esque boost in energy, sociability, and motivation for a few hours. Pure strength training has a smaller impact on my mood and energy.

* Diet has massive impact on brain fog and motivation. I binged on pizza and ice-cream on multiple occassions(my brain was craving dopamine possibly?) and every time I noticed huge loss in overall energy, mood, and motivation.

* I found MCTs from coconut oil in the morning and a low carb diet to be the most effective diet for alleviating brain fog and increasing motivation.

* Natural rhythms play a huge role in how we feel!

* Natural light and bright light is very important to getting rid of brain fog in the mornings.

* Excess caffeine made me very distracted. Before I quit I had difficulty staying focused. New thoughts and ideas would always pop up and I would find myself clicking over to google something irrelevant.

* Caffeine gives a real edge in social interactions. My baseline state is less energetic and less enthusiastic. I notice that I am less talkative, less interesting, less interested, and generally less outgoing without caffeine. 

* **The best way to maintain productivity and energy over the long-term is to take more rest and more breaks!** It's a pretty obvious statement but something that I haven't followed very well up to this point in my life. The reason I kept increasing my caffeine was because I kept taking on more and more obligations.

**Recommendations after 10 weeks**

To anyone who takes caffeine regularly I would recommend a 60 day detox. Spend the first 30 weaning yourself down(cut your intake in half each week) and the next 30 cold-turkey. I'm not advocating that everyone drop caffeine forever. I think there's very valuable lessons to be learned from getting off of caffeine. After you've spent 30 days caffeine free you can make a more educated decision on whether you want to get back on, what dose, and timing.

For me it reinforced a important lessons about exercise, nutrition, sleep, and overall mental health. I think it's easy to see caffeine as a ""fix-all"" and rely on it to cover up other areas of our lives that require attention.

Caffeine should be given the same level of consideration that we give ""harder"" substances like amphetamines, modafinil, and other ""drugs"". The ubiquitous nature of caffeine in our culture has given us the false impression that it's a harmless drug. It is not.

CILTEP Debunked,144,2crv37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2crv37/ciltep_debunked/,103,1407346716.0,"**Theory behind CILTEP**

* Artichoke extract is a good source of luteolin

* Luteolin is a PDE4 inhibitor and can thus raise cAMP levels

* Forskolin increases cAMP levels

* You can combine the two and create a significant elevation in cAMP levels and subsequent facilitation of LTP mediated by [CREB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREB), like you would get from a potent PDE4 inhibitor (rolipram).

**Problem 1**

Oral luteolin gets modified when it's absorbed

""Luteolin-7-O-glucoside was not present in human plasma or urine after administration of extracts A and B as well. Also, no free LUT could be detected in plasma or urine prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugates. However, after X -glucuronidase treatment LUT was identified. This indicates that after ingestion of ALE LUT was in plasma only available as phase-II-metabolites (sulfates or glucuronides)."" ^[[1]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15693705)

**Problem 2**

Artichoke extract is not actually a rich source of free-form luteolin

Even if it it was absorbed in an unmodified form, the actual amount of free form luteolin in artichoke is tiny, around .02% (60-220mg/kg). ^[[2]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22251096) When articles say ""luteolin-rich artichoke extract"", they're talking about *luteolins*, luteolin 7-0-rutinoside, luteolin-7-0-glucoside, luteolin-7-0-glucuronide and luteolin not specifically just free form luteolin.

Note: Luteolin-7-glucoside seems to have a similar but less potent PDE4 inhibiting profile, but Luteolin-7-glucoside is subject to intestinal hydrolysis and subsequently undergoes glucuronidation and is not detected in plasma after artichoke leaf extract is ingested. ^[[3]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15693705)

**Problem 3**

Even if it were injected to circumvent the intestinal glucuronidation problem, luteolin shows signs that emesis (vomiting) would still be an issue.

In this article noting luteolin's PDE4 inhibiting capabilities, they used the reversal of xylazine/ketamine-induced anesthesia to gauge luteolin's chances of causing emesis. PDE4 inhibitors are thought to induce vomiting through a noradrenergic pathway. ^[[4]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11114405) The ability of a PDE4 inhibitor to reverse xylazine/ketamine-induced amnesia seems to be an indicator of emetic potential, [ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10218871) Luteolin shows this potential. ^[[5]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19853596) So it's very likely a substantial increase in cAMP levels mediated by luteolin would cause vomiting.

**Problem 4**

Luteolin would have a narrow therapeutic window due to its lack of selectivity for PDE4.

If luteolin was significantly affecting cAMP levels due to inhibition of PDE1-5, we'd see a wide range of side effects, including gastric hypersecretion. ^[[5]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19853596)

**Problem 5**

The amount of forskolin generally talked about is too little to cause a significant elevation in brain cAMP levels

6.25mg/kg forskolin subcutaneously increases cAMP levels about 33% in rat brains,^[[6]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3035438) the human equivalent dose would be about 1mg/kg or 70mg for a 155lb individual. But unlike the typical forskolin+artichoke preparation, this forskolin was injected. 4mg orally isn't anywhere near enough.

**Problem 6**

If you did try to significantly raise cAMP levels with forskolin the side-effects would be hard to predict and wide ranging.

[cAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate) signalling is ubiqitous, [GPCR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor#cAMP_signal_pathway) commonly use cAMP as a second messenger and indirect increases in phosphorylation from [PKA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Kinase_A) would have even wider reaching effects. cAMP is used in many hormone and neurotransmitter systems. If the universal elevation of cAMP levels weren't downregulated this would affect many processes directly and almost all processes indirectly. Fortunately cAMP levels are controlled to some degree by activating PKA phosphorylation of [PDEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiesterase), inhibitory phosphorylation of adenylyl cyclase ^[[7]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11832336) and by stimulating additional expression of PDEs.

**Problem 7**

Solicited anecdotes don't suggest anything interesting is happening.

You do see the occasional glowing report from a user of artichoke extract and forskolin, but people who don't have this response tend to be ignored or probably more commonly they don't make posts about it. The archive of unsolicited user reports is most likely substantially biased in the direction of favorable reports. [Solicited user reports rate the combination as being extremely close to what they estimate could be a placebo effect, 5.3/10](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/16/nootropics-survey-results-and-analysis/).

**Problem 8**

Quercetin is sometimes brought up as an alternative, but it has the same transformation problems. ^[[8]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9199494) 

This shouldn't be surprising that most active compounds are made inactive during digestion. Being able to inactivate compounds would be extremely important for humans and their survival, these compounds (luteolin and quercetin) are found in hundreds of different plants, people on a healthy diet consume a significant amount everyday. ^[[9]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11410016)[[10]](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf00024a011)[[11]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11827770)

**Note:** Some conjugated flavonoids may be deconjugated in the body. But to what degree and in what location still remains a question. Certain [experiments on volunteers taking 200-400mg of quercetin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25076013) showed that deconjugation of quercetin seemed to reduce blood pressure presumably by causing vasodilation. In order for the flavonoids to be effective though, they need to get across the blood brain barrier in significant quantities before causing peripheral side effects. For the purpose of causing PDE4 inhibition in the brain the use of these flavonoids seems questionable. 

**TL;DR** 

Artichoke extract has nothing to do with LTP when ingested orally. *C*hemically *I*nduced *L*ong-*Te*rm *P*otentiation (CILTEP) is a misnomer. Don't assume PDE4 inhibitors are bad if you weren't impressed by artichoke+forskolin. The stack could be a placebo or there could be compounds in the extracts that are psychoactive, but the idea that the stack increases cAMP/CREB mediated LTP is almost definitely wrong.

Misc. Notes from One Year of Cerebrolysin: One of the Strongest Nootropics,146,eq7kwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/eq7kwo/misc_notes_from_one_year_of_cerebrolysin_one_of/,94,1579328737.0,"Less than one year ago I began taking Cerebrolysin (Cere). I posted a 21-day review of the compound here; I would recommend reading it before proceeding any further: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bg7vup/a\_threeweek\_review\_of\_the\_strongest\_nootropic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/bg7vup/a_threeweek_review_of_the_strongest_nootropic/)

After taking it quite regularly since, I have learned a lot the compound. I feel compelled to share my findings with the community, especially as there is not much other information available.

Here are the notes that I took over the past year. They are presented in no particular order.

# Misc. Notes:

* Contrary to my previous belief, Cere is stimulatory. I believe it is comparable to a theoretical very-long extended-release (40 hrs. +) of 10mg of Adderall. At the same time, I still believe that much of the power of the compound is due to nutrition, as opposed to stimulation. (Cere contains a decent amount of vitamins, minerals and peptides.)
   * For number's sake, its effect is probably due to a 50/50 split. 50% nutritive, and 50% stimulatory.
* Cere causes a decent amount of fatigue when dosed too high and for too long a period. I attribute this fatigue to the stimulation it produces.
   * For this reason, I would not recommend combining it with stimulants - bar low doses of caffeine.
* The effects are probably permanent. During my off periods, I noticed a fair few changes:
   * My senses are heightened.
      * I have been able to reduce the font size of the text editor I use for programming without eyestrain nor difficulty.
      * I am now much better able to make out objects from very long distances.
      * I am now typically the first to notice an unusual smell upon walking into a room.
      * My emotions are a lot stronger. I find that I now have an appropriate reaction to emotional stimuli that I would have normally been unresponsive to.
   * I am a lot more focused and motivated.
   * I am calmer - an unexpected effect.
   * I now feel far less tired during the day, and my sleep seems to be a bit better.
      * Sadly, I have not consistently maintained my life-logging (see the 21-day review), but two months ago I briefly restarted it for a month and found that my AM and PM tiredness levels have dropped by about 1.5 to 2 points.
   * My mental endurance is far greater. After a long day at work, I still have enough brain juice to smash out a few more hours of mentally-taxing activities (e.g. coding and language flashcards).
* Excessive dosing (10mL/day) can lead to brain fog (likely due to elevated BDNF) - this is different from the fatigue it can cause. I believe the optimal dosing protocol includes cycling (something around four weeks on / two weeks off), and dosing no more than 5mL per day during the 'on' periods.
   * Cere dosing seems to produce a reverse tolerance over time too. After about two cycles it might be best to drop to 5ml EOD.
* Supporting some anecdotes of Longecity: Cere does cause an increase in tip-of-the-tongue moments. This is likely due to either the BDNF-related brain fog or the fatigue from over-stimulation.
* Cortexin makes Cere stronger without much of an impact on fatigue or brain-fog.
* NSI-189 with Cere was an unpleasant experience for me, but maybe that is because I do not react too well to NSI by itself.
   * NSI and Cere made me far too over-emotional. I would be on the brink of tears over literally nothing.
* Cere increases one's metabolism by a great deal. I eat more than I normally do and have still managed to lose approx. 8kg of body weight in the past 9 months, while maybe adding 1kg of muscle.
* As far as Cere's immediate effects go, they are typically strongest the day after.
* Cere has been the most worthwhile nootropic that I have ever tried.

"[META] Regulatory Changes in China and the USA, Nootropics, PEDs and the Future",148,dzp5ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/dzp5ym/meta_regulatory_changes_in_china_and_the_usa/,79,1574396112.0,"Hello, 

We have several threads on pieces of the recent regulatory changes. Here is my attempt to synthesize them. 

Since this summer China has been banning, regulating and enforcing existing regulations against substances in the nootropics and PED industries. This has created fear, uncertainty and doubt. There is much truth to what you're hearing. 

Most of these changes were precipitated by the fentanyl and opioid crisis in the USA. The USA's trade representatives, specifically Lighthizer, have been pressuring China to change its enforcement and regulatory practices. Enforcing regulations against dangerous drugs like fentanyl is a good thing. But as we all know, there is a continuum and the line between a Big Brother state and reasonable regulation is blurry. Among the recent casualties is caffeine isolate. Right now there are people in China going to jail for selling caffeine powder. 

Recently a resolution was passed by the Supreme Court of China codifying these changes:

Many popular nootropics and PEDs are on that list. It will become increasingly difficult to procure all of these materials. Many vendors are looking to new jurisdictions for synthesis. It remains to be seen how successful that will be. China protected its laissez faire chemical industry. 

This week the USA introduced new legislation to ban SARMs and related PEDs:

However, after exhausting all my other options for my severe, crippling anxiety I finally broke down and decided to try ashwagandha after reading a lot of scientific evidence for its efficacy. I started taking Sensoril at 125mg 2x/day. For the first few days I had a honeymoon period of greatly reduced anxiety, but then it came back in full force. I stuck with it though, because I'd read that it produces the best results after 60 days of treatment. A month came and went with no change, and I was starting to have doubts about whether the treatment was going to work for me. Then almost exactly two months after starting treatment, my anxiety dropped greatly and has now stayed at a low level for several weeks. I'm still pretty anxious, but it's nowhere near the debilitating level it was before.

Yes-- if you take phenibut, you're likely to find yourself feeling giddy and chummy enough to strike up conversations. If you take adderall, cocaine, possibly modafinil, you'll find that you can't stop talking once you've started. If you take Xanax you'll feel warm and gentle and you just won't care what comes out of your mouth. Hell, have you tried having a few drinks before trying to socialise?


I've tried all of these and they do indeed work as advertised. But none of these are a wonder drug, and they're all addictive, or to use a term less loaded with stigma, habit-forming. And if you're really as socially dysfunctional as you say you are, the allure of suddenly shedding that anxiety is going to make you more vulnerable to the habit than average people.


Go ahead and try what's suggested, but rather than simply relying on the drugs to break you out of your shell, try to reflect on how your behaviour changed once you've come back to normal. If you take drugs and it leads to a positive interaction with someone, wake up the next day, put yourself in their shoes, and observe yourself.


What was it that you said to start the conversation? Did you really have to come up with something incredibly interesting, or did you just say ""hi"", give a genuine and comfortable smile, and let things go from there?


How did you maintain the conversation? Were you listening more deeply to what they said, responding with follow-up questions? Or were you on a bit of a roll? Maybe you simply let some weird and interesting thoughts just slip out of your mouth, not hesitating like you do when you're sober.


What did you do when you hit a lull in the conversation? Maybe you brought up an anecdote that was barely even (or not at all) related to the last topic--but that topic was dead--and your conversational partner was just as relieved as you were to have a new one. Or maybe you simply ended the conversation with grace, saying ""well, it was great talking to you, ____!""


Who did you talk to? It's not always about consuming enough chemicals so that you can work up the courage to talk to someone who intimidates you. Maybe you found another shy person, and found that you both shared a common intuition that conversation isn't always easy, which counter-intuitively made it easier to have one. Also, some people are the opposite of the common ""once you get to know them..."" wisdom. You might have a hard time talking to some particular person because behind their facade, they actually suck, and have nothing interesting to say.


My point is that even if you find your perfect drug, natural tolerance is going to build and you're going to find that it's less and less effective over time. Don't be one of those idiots who says, ""well, I took X dose the first time and it was great, but when I took it the second time it wasn't as great. This time I think I'll take X+1, just to see if that's a bit better...""
Rather, let the drug give you the push you need, but ultimately you'll have to be your own role model. You're still going to have to learn how to be social when you're sober, but let your sober self learn from your drug-influenced self, and remember that your final goal in social growth is to ditch the drug entirely.


Anyway I'm not trying to be your mother, nor am I trying to be your personal motivational speaker. You asked about social nootropics, and the best one is the dopamine that your brain naturally produces when you're enjoying deep social interaction-- once you've learned how to get there in a not-so-natural way.

"I wrote an article on HDAC Inhibitors geared toward the nootropics community, and here it is.",145,596gbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/596gbi/i_wrote_an_article_on_hdac_inhibitors_geared/,82,1477365406.0,"**HDAC Inhibition: Implications in Fear Extinction, Memory Enhancement, Social-Verbal Navigation, Addictive Behavior Extinction and More.**

Good timing for finishing this article since u/chemicalbiology just did an AMA, and he works closely with epigenetics related to learning and memory. It's an exciting new field of research.

First, I must give a **general guideline and disclaimer** about HDAC inhibitors. These are not piracetam… we can’t just take some and see what happens. These compounds, so far, are only used for cancer, they are relatively in their infancy for any use other than this, and are very powerful compounds. Please educate yourself on how they work and how exactly they should be used for what you’re planning on using them for. HDAC inhibitors can arrest the cell cycle (which is how they kill cancer), so they *cannot* be taken every day. HDAC inhibitors should also be taken at dosages much less than those recommended for cancer. They will still be quite strong enough for our uses at lower dosages. Vorinostat, for example, is taken at 400mg every day for cancer, but for memory enhancement one would take 150mg once in a four day period *maximum*.

That being said, HDAC inhibitors can be taken safely acutely, and have some incredible effects due to their unique mechanisms. Now let’s get to the good stuff!

I give some background info, then go fairly in depth into how some of their mechanisms work, and give some ideas on how we could use them.

[Here’s my imgur album of pictures used in this article, plus some extras](http://imgur.com/a/xezwI), and [a few articles](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q2nlxias0l68ee1/AACv6U_apNB546zinI_zh5eUa?dl=0) that are more in depth and a good place to start if you want to read more.

**Histones and DNA**

DNA is wrapped around histones, which [look like donuts](http://imgur.com/msBj4TI), while in the nucleus. It’s a way for DNA to be condensed and organized. DNA must be loosened from the histone for transcription (gene expression) to occur, and also for the DNA to be copied before cell replication.

**HAT**

Histone Acetyltransferases (HAT) are enzymes that acetylate histones to loosen the DNA from the histone, which turns the gene “on” and increases gene expression.

**HDAC**

Histone Deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histones causing the DNA to wrap tightly around the histone, turning the gene “off” and silencing gene expression. [HAT on, HDAC off](http://imgur.com/yiRSpA6).

There are [4 main classes of HDACs](http://imgur.com/71VyOPw), and we’ll be interested mostly in Class I here. Within HDAC Class I are the HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 proteins. You may have heard of the Class III HDACs… they are the [sirtuins](http://imgur.com/Pgd2eo8), linked to aging, inflammation, DNA repair, the circadian clock, mitochondrial biogenesis and more, and are unique among the HDACs by being the only ones not dependent upon zinc, but upon NAD instead.

**HDAC Inhibitors**

If we add an HDAC inhibitor into the mix, [HAT can turn a gene on, but HDAC can’t turn the gene back off](http://imgur.com/gOqaNnj). HDAC inhibitors keep genes from being turned off after they’ve been turned on.

**Examples of HDAC Inhibitors**

Each HDAC inhibitor [targets specific classes of HDAC and specific HDAC proteins within each class](http://imgur.com/8I1q3gf).

Vorinostat, for example, is a pan-HDAC inhibitor of sorts, inhibiting HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 and more to one degree or another (mostly Class I, some Class II). Neurostat (unknown structure, few studies) and Crebinostat (known structure, few studies) are HDAC inhibitors meant directly for memory and fear extinction, but are more expensive and harder to find than vorinostat. There are many other HDAC inhibitors, mostly used for specific types of cancer, but they are either much more expensive or not as useful for our purposes as Vorinostat.

HDAC inhibitors may have other effects in the body as well. Take valproic acid, for example. It is what I would call a dirty HDAC inhibitor because it does more than just inhibit HDAC. Its anti-seizure mechanisms are not even fully understood, it modulates GABA in possibly more than one way, it is an androgen and progesterone antagonist, and is a potent aromatase inhibitor blocking the synthesis of estrogen. HDAC inhibition is not even the main thing it’s used for, so as you can see you should not take valproic acid for its HDAC inhibiting properties.

Examples of natural compounds that have HDAC inhibiting properties include resveratrol, EGCG and Curcumin. Curcumin is unique in that it actually increases HDAC2 expression while being an effective inhibitor of HDACs 1, 3, 4 and 8. This HDAC2-promoting effect can cause complications in current or recent cigarette smokers by exacerbating lung cancer, so don’t take curcumin if you’ve been or are a smoker. Sirtuin activators, if you’re interested, include EGCG, Fisetin (one of my favs), Curcumin and Cacao.

[Butyrate](http://imgur.com/Hf4zays) is an HDAC inhibitor that is produced in our own bodies. It is the poop of our gut bacteria after they eat resistant starch (yes this something you can eat to feed your gut bacteria and increase butyrate production, look it up), and is not only necessary for the cells lining our colon to live, but passes on from there into our body to increase gene transcription through being an HDAC inhibitor, as well as help with inflammation, mental health, cancer, blood sugar/insulin, mitochondria health, aging and more.

GHB also is a light HDAC inhibitor.

**Fear Extinction**

Let’s take a look at exactly how HDAC inhibitors help extinguish fear, which can include other similar emotions including nervousness, anxiety, and avoidance.

When something is experienced, a short-term memory is created, more or less. It is then turned into a long-term memory if it happens repeatedly, if it is exceptionally novel or powerful, if we focus on it, can’t “get past it”, if it is associated with other memories, if it happens when we are younger, or any combination of the above. For the short-term memory to turn into a long-term memory, DNA transcription takes place to incur BDNF, which then writes the memory into long-term existence. This is called consolidation.

Fear exists as a memory just like everything else, and is always associated with a context memory. For example, a bell chimes and a mouse gets its foot shocked. The memory of the foot shock and the fear surrounding it will be associated with the memory of the bell chiming. Furthermore, because the bell chime and the foot shock were fairly novel and created pain and fear, the memory will likely be written into long-term memory, even if just weakly. One memory for the fear, one for the shock, one for the bell, and these memories will all be associated with each other across areas of the brain, so that when one is recalled so will the others.

Now for the interesting part about long-term memories. Every time a long-term memory is recalled, it is [reactivated, opened up again to transcription, and then reconsolidated](http://imgur.com/f2j8Xl8) through transcription by BDNF, exactly the same way it was first turned from a short-term memory into a long-term memory. This moment of recall opens the memory up to contextual modification, and strengthens the memory during reconsolidation. The more a memory is recalled and reconsolidated, the stronger the memory and its associations will be. The first couple times it is recalled and reactivated, it is more open to contextual changes because it is newer and weaker.

Let’s look back at our mouse model… A bell chimed and the mouse got shocked, so he made long-term memories of the bell, the shock, and the fear. Not very strong memories, but strong enough to be remembered. Then, a bell goes off again and the mouse gets shocked again. This time, the event is not novel, it is recognized, and the same long-term memories that were made the first time are recalled, reactivated and deemed to indeed be significant. Transcription occurs to reconsolidate the memories, and the memories are strengthened. Say this happens 10 times… by then that mouse has really learned that a bell means a shock, to the point that next time there is a bell that little mouse is going to be scared shitless whether there’s a shock or not.

In fact, there is a correlation in humans between the time a long-term fear memory has been in existence and how hard it is to overcome. The older a fear memory is, the harder it is to use clinical fear extinction methods to overcome the fear. In most cases, the fear memory becomes stronger whether the trigger is still there or not, because the fear memory is so strong that whenever it is recalled and reconsolidated, the additive effect of reconsolidation is always greater than the realization that there is no longer an actual threat, and that the trigger is in itself harmless.

For example, the loud sounds of a city can bring up long-term memories that make an ex-soldier feel the fear from experiences in a war he or she was in. The recollected fear will always reconsolidate stronger than any realization of there actually no longer being any danger. This is an evolutionarily built-in safety mechanism. There have been many psychological studies done on this phenomenon, and it is mentioned in a 2016 research article on HDAC inhibitors and mice like this: “Recent fear memories were found to attenuate quickly on fear extinction training and no sign of fear response recurred after 30 days. Though remote (month old) memories also reduce after fear extinction training, the cue or context-triggered fear responses have been found to re-emerge after 30 days. Hence behavioral training is not alone sufficient to reduce remote fear memories.” Other studies show that with strong or long-past fear memories no amount of fear extinction training will work, and that, no matter what, the memory will resurface and continue to grow, or at least maintain, depending on how active the PTSD sufferer is combatting triggers. This is why those suffering from PTSD often must be prescribed medication, even with thorough counseling. Now, with recent advancements in this arena, we have more efficacious and lasting solutions for these problems, including HDAC inhibitors.

*Here is where HDAC inhibitors come into play*. Remember that the window of reactivation isn’t open long enough to allow the updating of the emotional response to a trigger? What if we could hold that window open longer, so that we could overcome the fear memory associated with the trigger with a non-fear memory in one fell swoop? It just so happens that [this is exactly what HDAC inhibitors do](http://imgur.com/oEZrtsi).

When you take an HDAC inhibitor and “get rid of” a fearful memory, you’re actually not getting rid of it, you’re downplaying it. [The present is prioritized, overshadowing any grossly inflated fear memories](http://imgur.com/xN5yDDL). The downplayed old fear memories will go through “long-term depression” and wither away. What this whole mechanism feels like in real-time while on Vorinostat is essentially “nothing”. You feel like you have no emotional baggage tied to the present moment, and you are all of a sudden free to make what you want of it. The HDAC inhibitor holds open the transcription window during memory formation, enabling the real-time reevaluation of the old memories, and the ability to strongly consolidate the present moment into long-term memory. This double whammy makes sure the present moment is prioritized. HDAC inhibitors, while on them, also let you more deftly analyze any situation you’re in due to nearly everything during the session being written into long-term memory in one way or another. This allows for a relatively extraordinary amount of learning power. They give you not only a clean-slate emotion-wise, but the memory power to make more intelligent decisions. This is related to HDAC inhibitors’ memory-enhancing effects, which we’ll talk about later.

Let’s take a look at how to actually use an HDAC inhibitor for fear extinction, as in, what a session would look like. We have two choices: one, an experiential session, and two, a meditative, introspective session. They are both efficacious, but differ in character. No matter if you are in a place in real life or in your mind, the memory mechanisms are the same. Being in a place in real life may lead to a more thorough exploration of the triggers in that context and their related memories. This would be good for, say, if you are afraid of crowded places like a city. Simply go to a city on Vorinostat, and you will see that the HDAC inhibitor indeed works. However, if you have a harder-to-reach fear, a more esoteric fear, or some form of existential fear, a meditative approach would be best, delving into the memories and/or ideas. If you have several fears you’d like to delve into during one session, meditation would be good for this. I think what is best for most people is a combination of both approaches.

**Memory**

HDAC inhibitors [really shine when it comes to the realm of memory and learning enhancement](http://imgur.com/rMtMqbz), especially when it comes to making and breaking habits or habit-like processes. I use “habit-like process” for a system that takes a strong and efficacious long-term memory to be able to learn. These are things that, on average, children have an easier time learning, like language, perfect pitch, and vocabulary. Children are better and more in the habit of consolidating and modifying their long-term memory in order to build systems in their mind to understand and interact with the world around them. Adults may have a better one-off long-term memory (sometimes), but children are better at building these larger systems of understanding, simply because they have bigger and more things to learn than do adults, not to mention a child’s biology is operating at a different level than an adult’s to begin with.

If you take an HDAC inhibitor, however, this child-like quality of plasticity is opened up to you, and you are able to learn things like perfect pitch or an instrument as easily as a child would, if not easier. The HDAC inhibitor does this through the same mechanism that allows us to overcome trauma -- by holding open transcription to allow present circumstances to be written into long-term memory efficiently and powerfully.

This is obviously great for things like learning an instrument, vocabulary, scientific literature, studying for a test, ecetera. Things can get deeper and more subtle that this, however...

These memory effects go great with social interaction and various types of social anxiety, or even something as simple as keeping your cool and having good word recall during an interview. Along with the social habits we made as we were growing up, some of the habits or even fears that are brought up in us while we interact socially can be connected to weird things from our early childhood, and those subtle habits and fears are very hard to touch. With an HDAC inhibitor, however, even these deep-seated fears, anxieties, and habits in general, are up for grabs (but may take several sessions to fully extinguish/revamp to prevent relapse, according to animal models. But, the special thing about HDAC inhibitors is that you can even get to these deep-seated memories in the first place.). The HDAC inhibitor drops any emotional baggage at the door, and gives you the ability to use the present as well as past memories to form new ideas about vocabulary use, body language, facial expressions and more, in real-time, allowing you to dramatically revamp, recondition and update your social habits. Situational awareness is enhanced.

*General Disclaimers*: HDAC inhibitors work subtly. HDAC inhibitors do not blunt your emotions. Nor do they need to bring up emotions to extinguish them. They don't cause a relapse of anything. Quite the opposite, actually. They're fear extinguishing and mental effects are felt in real-time. They do not make you forget anything. Indeed, they actually help you remember things. I briefly describe in the ""cancer"" section how the effects of Vorinostat felt to me, and I'd be glad to answer any more questions about my experiences.

**Addiction**

Another use of HDAC inhibitors… addictive behavior extinction.

[Cocaine study 1](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n4/abs/nn.3354.html), [study 2](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/7/2647/F1.expansion.html), [alcohol study 1](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr343/293-305.htm), and [study 2](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr344/495-505.htm).

**Cancer**

Briefly, this is how HDAC inhibitors are used to kill cancer (they’re main use as of yet). If you take them consistently and in high enough doses, they don’t allow DNA to condense onto their histones (changing euchromatin to heterochromatin), which is a checkpoint in the cell cycle that needs to be met before chromosomes are copied, allowing the cell to replicate. The cell cycle is stopped, or “arrested”. Some types of cancer are sensitive to this mechanism because of how they grow, but our healthy cells can handle it for the most part, so [the cancer dies and we live](http://imgur.com/9j3Ne26).

Most normal, healthy cells can handle this effect to a degree, but some are more sensitive to it, so side-effects can appear with everyday HDAC inhibitor use during cancer therapy. The few times I took Vorinostat I couldn’t even tell it was in me physically except that my body was devoid of the normal somewhat-debilitating stress-fear-tightness feeling I get in certain situations, which of course was a very welcomed effect, so it seems that acute administration isn’t enough to arrest the cell cycle enough for negative effects to occur (this is corroborated by the many studies that’ve been done on the effects of HDAC inhibition on fear and memory in mice).

**Safety Aspects**

This brings me to the safety of contemporary HDAC inhibitors. I’ve already mentioned my views on this elsewhere in this article, so I’ll just quote from “HDAC inhibitors as cognitive enhancers in fear, anxiety and trauma therapy: where do we stand?” here.

“Despite early reports of possible neurotoxic effects of some HDAC inhibitors [89], most of these drugs are remarkably well tolerated, in both humans and other animals, where they are mainly administered chronically as anti-cancer agents. Reported side effects include diarrhoea, myelosuppression and cardiac QT persistence [90]. As HDAC inhibitors are suggested to be predominantly acutely administered to augment CBT therapy, it may be expected that even these side effects are somewhat mitigated. In principle, systemically applied HDAC inhibitors act globally in targeted and non-targeted tissues, opening the possibility of widespread off-target effects. Interestingly, however, for example in learning and memory, there seems to be (at least to some extent) gene and brain area specificity of acetylation changes. ‘Epigenetic priming’ was postulated as a possible explanation for these observations, stating that HDAC inhibitors have more pronounced effects in those particular genes and brain areas, which, by learning, have already been primed via associated neural activity-induced chromatin remodelling [39]. Thus, according to this hypothesis, HDAC inhibitors would reinforce already occurring (but in some cases insufficient) gene expression activity, whereas its effect in other brain areas or peripheral tissues with low baseline activity would be minimal. However, future studies will need to carefully clarify in particular the long-term consequences of HDAC inhibitor treatment in targeted and non-targeted tissues.”

Their mention of “epigenetic priming” can also be thought of in terms of HAT and HDAC. For an HDAC inhibitor to hold transcription open, [HAT has to first open it](http://imgur.com/gOqaNnj). No HAT, then no gene expression, then no HDAC, then nothing for an HDAC inhibitor to do. HDAC inhibitors only count when DNA was going to express itself anyway. They believe that the brain has been “epigenetically primed” for being sensitive to HDAC inhibition because of the high amount of transcription (the high activity of HAT and HDAC) that happens there already.

We should reserve HDAC inhibitor use for those that are **over 18** because of the high amount of cell replication and DNA transcription that takes place for growth and development during the younger years.

**Conclusion**

There are [more uses](http://imgur.com/wPl21HX) for HDAC inhibitors than the ones I’ve listed here, and even ways to use them differently for the things I have listed.

HDAC inhibition is a very modern realm of research with [new info](http://imgur.com/P3zybRP) coming out every week, so within the next few years we can expect some interesting compounds coming out in this realm as well as in [the realm of epigenetics in general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics_in_learning_and_memory). I’m especially excited for new, more selective HDAC inhibitors that target specific effects like fear extinction, learning, or addiction.

I was planning on hosting a **group buy** for Vorinostat, which has happened a couple times over at Longecity before and went well (they were small, though), but I found a much better option! I’m very excited about it and I’m going to make a separate post on this soon. Stay tuned!

Maybe that is because people with anxiety only make up 18% of the population, and stimulants can benefit everyone (in specific circumstances, mind you). But I've had people actually go as far as to argue that anxiolytics are in their own category, whereas I disagree. If you are suffering a fit of anxiety, or a build up of worry in your head, be it in anticipation for something or accumulation of stress, do you know how mentally taxing that is on you? It slows you down, lowers your rationality and decision making abilities, and can deplete all of your energy after prolonged exposure. Now, by no means am I saying everyone should go and pop a xan, but with light/ non-recreational anxiolytics taken in appropriate doses (not to the point of sedation), an anxiolytic can be incredibly lifting/ motivating.

I'm pretty much the spokesperson for American Skullcap at this point, but I take it and it does not sedate me. Rather, I just feel a reduction in stress and anxiety that is healthy for someone like me. I suggest it to everyone as an alternative to prescription meds.

"BPC-157 might permanently increase Amphetamine tolerance; In rats, a single injection of BPC-157 reduced the stimulant effects of an Amphetamine dose given 46 days later",143,86g8jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/86g8jd/bpc157_might_permanently_increase_amphetamine/,64,1521790820.0,"BPC-157 is a peptide frequently mentioned on this subreddit, due to numerous anecdotes of people using it to reverse acquired neurotoxicity from prolonged Amphetamine use. It was found to attenuate chronic Amphetamine-induced behavioral disturbances, in rats^[[1]](http://www.chinaphar.com/article/view/7579/8083) .

However, the exact same study found that a single injection of BPC-157 in rats, has decreased the stimulant effects of Amphetamine given immediately afterwards, and also for a few days afterwards (conditioning period). The rats were then left alone, and intermittently given Amphetamine doses throughout the withdrawal period: Amphetamine was given on day 8, day 16, and day 46 of withdrawal. 

Rats injected with BPC-157 on day 0 showed significantly weaker stimulant effects from Amphetamine on days 8, 16, and 46, compared to non-treated rats. This has happened only with a *single* injection of BPC-157.

From [Examine's BPC-157 page](https://examine.com/supplements/bpc-157/):

>There appear to be some influence of BPC-157 on dopaminergic systems, where it limits the efficacy of dopamine agonists. It is not currently known how this occurs. 

.

>This apparently **antagonistic effect may also apply chronically**, meaning a single dose of BPC-157 (10 μg/kg I.P; 10 ng/kg ineffective) given before chronic amphetamine administration seemed to attenuate the behavioral effects of amphetamine in rats throughout the observation period.

This could mean BPC-157 possibly modulates the dopamine system, rendering it less sensitive to dopamine agonists, and that this might be a permanent effect. If this is true, this could be worrying for people who use BPC-157 to repair Amphetamine-related neurotoxicity, but yet plan to use it in the future in lower, therapeutic doses.

**TL;DR:** BPC-157 reduces the effects of certain dopamine agonists (more accurately, indirect agonists like Amphetamine), in a possibly permanent way. Rats that were given a single dose of BPC-157 show a significantly lower response to Amphetamine 46 days later, meaning BPC-157's antagonistic effects of Amphetamine are extremely long-lasting, and perhaps permanent.",2018-03-23 13:10:20

EDIT1: Thanks for all your questions we just started ill try and answer them this evening

EDIT2: Ive answered some questions more later, we need to code :)

EDIT3:  OK intial results are in:

Product Manager - Found it more productive, creative and easier to communicate

Dev Ops - Some improvement but not tangible

Rails Coders - No noticable improvements, one bad stomach

I think based on this and other variables we will pause the trial for now, Product Manager and Dev Ops will keep going, and if anyone wants us to trial anything else let us know.  

We already did L-Theanine + caffeine that went well, we are all for trying new things to improve coding, creativity & song writing with Nootropics.

Systemic inflammation during midlife and
cognitive change over 20 years
The ARIC Study

Neurology® 2019;92:1-12. doi:10.1212/WNL.0000000000007094

Abstract

Objective
To examine the association between systemic inflammation measured during midlife and 20-
year cognitive decline.

Methods

Within the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study, inflammatory biomarkers were
measured during middle adulthood. We created an inflammation composite score using 4
blood biomarkers measured at visit 1 (fibrinogen, white blood cell count, von Willebrand factor,
and factor VIII); we measured C-reactive protein (CRP) at visit 2. Cognition was assessed over
3 visits spanning 20 years using measures of memory, executive function, and language.

Results

A total of 12,336 participants (baseline age 56.8 [5.7], 21% black, 56% women) were included.
After adjusting for demographic variables, vascular risk factors, and comorbidities, each standard deviation (SD) increase in midlife inflammation composite score was associated with an
additional 20-year decline of −0.035 SD (95% confidence interval: −0.062 to −0.007) on the
cognitive composite score. We found a similar association between each SD increase in midlife
CRP level and additional 20-year cognitive decline (−0.038 SD, 95% confidence interval:
−0.057 to −0.019). ***Participants with a midlife inflammation composite score in the top quartile
had a 7.8% steeper cognitive decline, compared to participants in the lowest quartile; CRP in
the top quartile was associated with an 11.6% steeper cognitive decline. In cognitive domainspecific analyses, elevated midlife inflammatory markers were most consistently associated with
declines in memory***. Results were similar after adjusting for attrition using inverse probability
weighting.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight what may be an early pathogenic role for systemic inflammation as
a driver of cognitive decline in the decades leading up to older adulthood.",2019-02-16 13:57:30

Why We Sleep: Part II,142,8dgi9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8dgi9a/why_we_sleep_part_ii/,58,1524188270.0,"Several days ago, I posted a [book recommendation]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8c1q7l/book_recommendation_why_we_sleep/) for, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, by Matthew Walker, PhD.  I posted several samples of findings based on clinical research that is referenced in the book.  Since I got a pretty decent response last time, I figured I would add in some more.  Please understand that these points will not all contain the same level of detail, simply based on personal time constraints while listening to the book (I basically listen to the book while doing housework and then run and jot stuff down real quick that I find interesting).  I’m still only about half-way through the book.

* A University of Pennsylvania study was done to discover the severity/scale of sleep deprivation on several groups of people, each going multiple days with varying amounts of sleep. Those individuals who slept for eight hours maintained good performance on stimuli requiring acknowledgement/response. (The author uses a term, “microsleep” to describe failing to respond to stimuli due to a momentary lapse in conscious awareness caused by lack of sleep). A group that was totally sleep deprived for 72 hours suffered a catastrophic loss in responses.  After the first night of no sleep, lapses in concentration/missed responses increased by over 400%.  Each night of no sleep brought increasingly worse impairment—there was no tapering off of the effect.  For the group that only got four hours per night for six nights, participants’ performance was just as bad as those who had not slept at all for 24 hours. By day 11, their performance was as bad as those who had gone without sleep for two full days.  But most significantly for majority of ya’ll reading this: **It only took 10 days for the group who only got SIX hours of sleep per night for them to be just as impaired as those who did not sleep for 24 hours.**  Troublingly, all signs showed that like the no sleep group, the 4-hour and 6-hour groups would have seen an increasing level of performance loss for each subsequent day on their respective sleep regimens, perhaps indefinitely. Another study done by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research showed nearly identical results.   
* For the above, after three nights of ad lib recovery sleep to “pay off their sleep debt”, performance levels did not return to the baseline assessment level. Nor did any group recover all hours of sleep loss from the days prior (the brain is incapable of this).
* You don’t know how sleep deprived you are when you are sleep deprived.  When asked their subjective sense about how impaired they are, participants consistently underestimated their degree of performance disability.  Another dangerous phenomenon is “baseline resetting”, where after chronic sleep deprivation over months or years, an individual will acclimate to their lower level of performance, which becomes their accepted norm, or “baseline”.  They will fail to recognize how their chronic sleep deficiency has come to compromise their cognitive and physical vitality, including the slow accumulation of ill health (the link between energy levels and sleep will rarely be made in their mind).  They will not reach their full potential, because their acclimation will disguise the fact that they are operating at less than optimal levels.  Millions of individuals spend their lives like this, based on epidemiological studies.  The author references 60 years worth of sleep research when he refuses to believe anyone who claims that they “can get by on just four or five hours of sleep per night, just fine”.
* You may have heard of what some call the “sleepless elite”, or individuals who can routinely sleep for just 6 hours with almost no cognitive performance impairment.  This phenomenon has been linked to a very rare variant of the BHLHE41 gene.  **However, it is dangerous to assume that this applies to you.** You are statistically more likely to be struck by lightning than to be a carrier of this variant.
* In an Australian study, a group of participants got drunk to the legal driving limit (.08%), and  another group was sleep deprived for a single night.  Both groups performed a concentration test to assess attention performance (the number of lapses of concentration).  After being awake for 18 hours, the sleep deprived group was just as cognitively impaired as a legally drunk driver.  In fact, their nosedive in performance started just 15 hours after being awake. And each hour of sleep loss increases performance impairment exponentially, not incrementally. Also, the combination of being drunk AND sleep deprived increases a driver’s chances of an accident multiplicatively, not additively.
* At another point, the author claims that after 10 days of just 7 hours of sleep, performance decreases as much as someone who has been awake for 24 hours.  The author takes this opportunity to reiterate that 3 nights of recovery sleep (more than a weekend) is still insufficient to restore performance.  Bottomline: **You need to get MORE than seven hours of sleep every night throughout the week.** (Personally, I can’t say that I do this.)
* Sleep deprived people have lower connectivity between the amygdala (responsible for the experience of emotions) and the prefrontal cortex, which is a logic center of the brain.  Sleep deprived participants in a study were shown a series of pictures, ranging from neutral to negative, and were asked to respond with their feelings toward them. Sleep deprived participants showed a much greater negative response, and showed 60% amygdala activity in a brain scan. Pre-frontal cortex often failed to contextualize the images enough for the minds of the participants to avoid emotional reactions.
* The same participants in the above study also showed greater brain activity in the striatum (reward system), which caused hyperactivity and impulsivity (more pleasure seeking behavior).  Sleep deprived individuals showed a sort of manic-depressant tug-of-war between striatum and amygdala control, which the pre-frontal cortex was helpless to mediate.  Sleep deprived individuals are more prone to chemical and behavioral addictions.
* Pulling an all-nighter and then trying to learn something mid-day the next day results in a 40% deficit in the ability to learn.  This was shown even after the subjects were given two-days of recovery sleep to demonstrate that the inability to remember was due to a failure of information acquisition, and not just due to failure of recall during a sleep-deprived state.  The author uses this to discourage all-nighters when studying for final exams, and even got rid of finals and changed the structure of his own courses to discourage this among his students.  (He sent a letter chastising fellow professors at UC Berkley for their role in causing this counter-productive behavior in their own students, but the professors shifted the blame and refused to change.) 
* You don’t even need complete sleep deprivation to affect learning capacity.  Simply disrupting NREM sleep with infrequent sounds (which keeps a person in a more shallow state of sleep without actually waking them up) can produce similar impairments.  (Sleep with earplugs if you live in a noisy area, I guess)
* It was found that in people with Alzheimer’s disease, beta-amyloid plaque buildup particularly affects the frontal lobe, which is necessary for NREM sleep production.  NREM is critical for long-term memory.
* In relation to the above, they glymphatic system is responsible for emptying metabolic debris (including beta-amyloid plaque, harmful proteins etc.) via the glial cells.  Glial cells are 20x more active during NREM sleep, when the majority of beta-amyloid is removed.  So more amyloid plaque, less sleep. Less sleep, more plaque.
* Sleep deprivation even affects the DNA and the learning related genes in the brain cells of the hippocampus itself. (epigenetically switching off genes that are useful for learning)
* A nap, before a bout of sleep deprivation, was shown to be more effective at maintaining wakefulness than taking a nap in the midst of sleep deprivation.  Researchers sought to answer a question posed by the Federal Aviation Administration: If a pilot flying long, overnight flights can only obtain a short nap (40-120 min) during a 36 hour period, when should it occur, so as to minimize cognitive fatigue and attention lapses?  At the start of the first evening, in the middle of the night, or late the following morning?  The researchers’ prediction that a nap as a prophylactic is more effective than as a cure, was correct; Pilots suffered fewer microsleeps if the nap was taken early on the first evening, rather than late at night or early the following morning.  

The following are general health points that the book covers as thoroughly as the above, but I deprioritized the detail of most of them because of time constraints and since this isn’t a general health subreddit, but I figured ya’ll still might like to know:

* Lack of sleep increases: Cortisol, heart rate, blood pressure, bad gut bacteria (leading to less nutrient absorption), calcification of the arteries, and ghrelin production.
* Lack of sleep decreases: Growth hormones needed to repair the lining of blood vessels, glucose uptake into cells (significantly), and leptin production
* Two groups of individuals were put on a strict diet plan in a medical facility for a fortnight.  Group A was given 8.5 hours in bed, group B was given 5.5 hours.  Both lost weight, but 70% of group B’s weight loss came from muscle, whereas less than 50% of group A’s came from muscle.  
* Sleep deprived individuals show a significant shift in preference toward sweets/simple carbs.
* For men: Less sleep results in less testosterone, lower sperm count, more sperm abnormalities, lower mood, and vigor, smaller testes.  
* For women: Women working irregular work hours that compromise sleep had 33% higher chance of abnormal menstrual cycles.  85% more likely to suffer sub-fertility issues.  Miscarriages more common in pregnant women getting less than 8 hours of sleep.

* Studies show that better sleep makes you more physically attractive.

* Less sleep made participants in one study much more likely to get sick when an active flu virus was sprayed up their nostrils.
* Less sleep can result in lower anti-body response when vaccinated, resulting in failure of vaccination.
* Circulating levels of Natural Killer cells (which target cancerous cells for destruction) are reduced by 70% simply from a single night of just four hours of sleep relative to a full eight hours.

That’s all I’ve got for now.  **I want to reiterate that these slim-pickings of cliff notes still do not do the book justice.**  There is still MUCH value added in you listening to or reading the book yourself…I simply can’t emphasize this enough.  You are also much more likely to internalize these revelations when you get it from the horse’s mouth rather than them being filtered down to you by some random douche like me on the internet.  Regardless, I hope you’ve found these insights interesting, if not useful.

Some of the vendors approached us looking for a way to advertise here, but have the money benefit the community directly. So we came up with a plan where they could sponsor 3rd party purity testing through us. They will donate funds to an account we have set up that will be used to test nootropics from the community. For doing so, they will be recognized in the FAQ with being an /r/Nootropics supporter.

We have been complacent for too long, ingestigating substances with only manufacturer COAs. Sometimes we don't even have reliable COAs at all. Along with my upcoming objective nootropic studies, this step should bring some scientific data that we have been lacking. Yes the study is still going forward. Samples from the HSW batches that will be used in the study are being tested as we speak at the lab. Once the results are back, we can move forward with the study.

Sophie from Modup has also donated funds to test two batches of nootropics. She has been very enthusiastic about helping the community out, and we thank her for being the first to donate money to the testing fund!

Now all we need to do is determine which nootropics should be the first tested. I am leaning toward the new piracetam pills from piracet.am and perhaps the numbing choline from Cerebral Health. What does everyone think?

The Importance of Maintaining Normal 5-AR Activity for Calmness.,142,arnhc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/arnhc0/the_importance_of_maintaining_normal_5ar_activity/,68,1550457605.0,"5-Alpha Reductase (5-AR) is an enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of Testosterone (T) into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  I’m sure this is well-known by now.  However, 5-AR also converts the hormone progesterone (P) into Dihydroprogesterone (DHP).  (1) These two reactions are both very important for anxiolysis.  In fact, this also makes maintaining normal Testosterone and Progesterone levels important for anxiolysis.  This will be a small post explaining a little more into the relatively complex neurosteroid system we all possess. 


Progesterone is a very important and well known hormone, synthesized in the body from Pregnenolone (which is synthesized from Cholesterol).  Upon interacting with 5-AR, it converts into Dihydroprogesterone.  (It should be noted here that DHP is a weak positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(a) receptor.  Through one more conversion (3a-HSD), DHP is converted into Allopregnanolone (ALLO). (1)


ALLO is a very special molecule.  For starters, it as a powerful positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(a) receptor, so powerful that it can be used as a legitimate anticonvulsant.  Moreover, the predominant medication for increasing ALLO levels (the anti-anxiety drug Etifoxine) shows little to no signs of tolerance. (3) There is evidence for its pro-social, and pro-sexual effects. (4) Inhibiting 5-AR with Finasteride, or even with smaller inhibitors like megadose Riboflavin, or various herbs, may need to be rethought, at least under normal conditions.


However, it is not just ALLO that exerts these effects.  There is a lesser known neurosteroid known as Androstanediol (STAN) which originates from Testosterone and has also been found to have the exact same effects.  (Yes, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(a) with pro-sexual, anxiolytic effects. (5,6) Its creation occurs by the exact same process (5-AR and 3a-HSD) (T—>DHT—>STAN).

Progesterone also is capable of converting into Deoxycorticosterone, which eventually ends up (through the same process) as THDOC.  This one is more tricky, since under normal conditions it behaves like allopregnanolone, (Yes, those same old good anxiolytic effects the others have) (7) but reduces GABAergic activity following periods of high stress.  Thus, using a 5-AR inhibitor like Curcumin during periods of high stress could reduce the highly elevated THDOC, and normalize GABA transmission. 


It should be realized that the complex neurosteroid system holds incredibly important functions.  As someone may point out, there are also neurosteroids (Pregenolone Sulfate for example) that are Negative Allosteric Modulators of GABA(a) as well.  This is true, but they are not as dependent on the 5-AR enzyme.  


I know many are aware Finasteride reduces DHT and thus can create sexual dysfunction.  However, it is also capable of disrupting ALLO, and some researchers believe this is why Finasteride can induce anxiety and depressive behavior. (8)

So, Testosterone and Progesterone, as well as their converting enzymes 5AR and 3aHSD, are important for this array of GABAergic neurosteroids.  Inhibiting these important enzymes, or blunting testosterone or progesterone, may be a very bad thing to do.  I don't believe 5-AR inhibitors should be used in young people who are not trying to recover from a period of high stress.  These neurosteroids actively prevent stress and anxiety.

What SEMAX did for me,145,b603zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/b603zg/what_semax_did_for_me/,107,1553690522.0,"I should preface this by saying that I am a former drug addict and I have lost certain aspects of myself. Cognitively and emotionally. I've tried several nootropics. Every racetam, rgpu, mushrooms (medical lol) magtein, NAC, nsi 189, bromantane, vitamin d, uridine, etc. I've managed to reclaim my episodic memory, which was toast before I started this journey.

 My motivation and cognitive abilities have been pretty stellar. However, I abused meth pretty heavily last year and it stripped away some of my basic social inclinations. Willful socialization for the sake of socialization has been at an all time low. I mostly lurk on reddit, passively taking in information without contributing much, occasionally memes related to another interest, but discussions and interactions have been negligible. 

Basically it felt as if meth had burnt out my drive to socialize and I was prepared to live with this until my brain got around to repairing itself at some unforeseeable point in the future. Well, I recently got some Semax, from Russia, and thus far it's been a game changer. 

All of a sudden I am feeling like myself again. I am cracking jokes when I'm with others, I am thanking people for things just because I can. I feel less like a piece of cardboard and more like a human. I have been having conversations with my father after dinner without feeling strained or like I'm forcing it. 

Now, these may not seem like huge things to the average person, but to me, this is something I wasn't sure I would experience again. And thus far the effects have persisted between doses, and it hasn't been long enough to say for sure if this will last, but even if I do need to keep administering the peptide to feel like myself again, it isn't all that cost prohibitive, all things considered. I am hopeful. 

tl;dr
Amphetamine abuse dampened my drive to socialize. Semax seems to have restored it.",2019-03-27 18:12:02
A forgotten peptide: MIF-1 and its potential for treating Depression,139,81v007,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/81v007/a_forgotten_peptide_mif1_and_its_potential_for/,74,1520160011.0,"**The Melanocortin system (which MIF-1 effects)**
-
Recently, I have been researching quite a bit about the *Melanocortin system* and its therapeutic potential. One of the most interesting things I found was this [article from Stanford Medicine.](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/07/why-the-thrill-is-gone-scientists-identify-potential-target-for-treating-major-system-of-depression.html) The article talks about the discovery of a possible molecular mechanism responsible for an important and debilitating symptom of Depression: **Anhedonia** (i.e. apathy, lack of pleasure, interests, and motivation). 

It turns out that the Melanocortin pathway is deeply involved in the brain's reward circuitry. Studies in the past have suggested that chronic stress leads to an increase of the Melanocortin hormone in the brain in addition to an increase of Melanocortin receptors in the *Nucleus Accumbens* (region involving reward and motivation). 

What was found according to this article, was that **chronic stress (found to increase Melanocortin), as well as direct administration of Melanocortin in mice, lead to a *decrease* in the signaling strength of nerve cells in the *Nucleus Accumbens* causing a loss of ability to experience pleasure.** On the other hand, when those same mice had thair Melanocortin receptors removed the same stressful conditions no longer lead to changes in the nerve cells of the Nucleus Accumbens and the mice's sugar preference returned to normal. 

This opens up a potentially new and exciting target for treating depression and anhedonia from chronic stress. The Melanocortin system is involved in many interesting aspects involving appetite, sexuality, emotions and skin pigmentation. This system includes two hormones which I will talk about: **MIF-1 *and* alpha-MSH.**

[MIF1 - Melanocyte-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting factor-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte-inhibiting_factor) or just **Melanocyte-inhibiting factor** for short, is a peptide-hormone derived from a cleavage of the hormone *oxytocin* and is known to block alpha-MSH ([alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone)) which is a *full agonist* of Melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4 and MC5 (there are five receptors in total). 

In line with the article presented above, [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3397405/) has shown that *anhedonia* from chronic stress requires specifically *MC4 receptor-mediated synaptic adaptations in nucleus accumbens.* From my understanding of the Stanford article, such '*synaptic adaptations*' occur due to the increase of Melanocortin hormones i.e. alpha-MSH and since MIF-1 blocks alpha-MSH, MIF-1 would block ""*MC4 receptor-mediated synaptic adaptations*"" and thus the ability of stress to cause anhedonia. This brings up the interesting question of what therapeutic aspects would MIF-1 have on depression or the mind in general? This is where it gets exciting as I will present here promising studies on Mice *and Humans*.         

**MIF-1 as an Antidepressant**
-

Indeed [studies on mice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14yTXkEvQO6xoht0y7lKaaOTuWOdAWhRE/view?usp=sharing) have shown MIF-1 to act as an effective antidepressant but what's more interesting are the ones on humans:

**1.** First double-blind study: [(Rudolph H. Ehrensing and Abba J. Kastin 1974) - Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone-Release Inhibiting Hormone as an Antidepressant](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/491057?redirect=true)
-
>In a double-blind, clinical trial, four of five patients with mental depression, who received 60 mg of MRIH-I for each of six consecutive days, experienced marked improvement for their symptoms within. two to three days.

**2.** [(Rudolph H. Ehrensing and Abba J. Kastin 1978) - Dose-related biphasic effect of prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (MIF-I) in depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25588)
-
>Five of 8 patients with unipolar or bipolar endogenous depressions taking prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (MIF-I), 75 mg/day, showed substantial improvement within a few days of beginning treatment compared with similar improvement in only 1 of 10 receiving 750 mg/day of MIF-I and only 1 of 5 patients taking placebo. The lower dose of MIF-I was associated with significantly greater improvement than both the higher dose and placebo on all of the rating scales used. The authors suggest that an even lower dose of MIF-I, on the order of 0.1 mg/kg, may have a greater effect as an antidepressant.

**3.** [(Christiaan D.van der Velde 1983) - Rapid clinical effectiveness of MIF-I in the treatment of major depressive illness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0196978183901365#!)
-
>A double-blind 28 day study was conducted to compare the anti-depressant efficacy of MIF-I with that of imipramine. Twenty patients hospitalized with major depressive illness participated. Clinical responses were measured by using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Global Severity of Illness Scale, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale as well as the 100 mm line self-rating for depression. The results indicate that MIF-I was at least as effective as imipramine in this study, and that its anti-depressant effect was a rapid and often dramatic one.

There were two studies that failed to show statistically significant improvements. One by *Ehrensing and Kastin 1980*, with a dose of 10 mg/day p.o. and another by *Levy et al., 1982* using the same doses and protocol as the study by *van der Velde (1983)*. Although, The hospital patient population of this study were reported to give ‘absurd’, ‘arbitrary’ and ‘perseveratory’ responses on the self-rating forms that precluded their use in analysis of the results. 

The last and most significant study was again conducted by Rudolph H. Ehrensing and Abba J. Kastin (1994) and its results were the most promising:

**4.** [(Rudolph H. Ehrensing and Abba J. Kastin 1994) Improvement in major depression after low subcutaneous doses of MIF-1](http://www.jad-journal.com/article/0165-03279490098-1/pdf), [Full Text](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACMYUZO1DloTWDoFRPK0f8UlmtMkLOJr/view?usp=sharing)
-
>In this double-blind pilot study, 20 significantly depressed patients who all met the DSM-III R criteria for major depression were given a single subcutaneous injection of either 10 mg MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2) or placebo on each of 5 consecutive days. Treatments were reversed for a second week of 5 consecutive daily injections. At the end of the first week, the group receiving MIF-1 was significantly improved on all rating scales as compared with the group receiving placebo. Eight out of 9 patients receiving MIF-1 showed marked improvement (score ≤ 7 on the Hamilton Scale) as compared with only 2 of 11 patients receiving saline (P<0.01). Administration of MIF-1 during the second week to the patients who had received placebo during the first week resulted in substantial improvement so that by the end of the second week the two groups were indistinguishable.

By the end of the 13 days, when all patients were injected with the MIF-1 peptide, **17 out of the 20 in the study scored below 3 on the Hamilton scale!** Whats more, **all 17 retained their improvement even after 1 mouth with 12 maintaining their improvement for periods from 6 months to over 2 years when last contacted!** These results suggest MIF-1 to be highly effective in reducing depression even in comparison to Ketamine. From my research, The first Ketamine infusion on average may reduce depression symptoms to around 15 on the MADRS scale. Repeated injections can bring the depression even lower on that scale but the results are usually short-lived and patients tend to relapse around 18 days from the last injection: 

>*""Among responders, median time to relapse following the last ketamine infusion was 18 days.""*
source -https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725185/pdf/nihms473792.pdf

This has to be said carefully since this is a very small scale study but a ***84% response rate + long-lasting effect (above 4 months for most) + fast acting (1 week) + almost nonexistent side effects*** is unprecedented when it comes to current anti-depression treatments and even yet to be released treatments. Maybe it's a bit naive to get too excited about this since again, the number of people tested was low but the results are just too promising to let this peptide be forgotten the way it has.

**Attempts to bring MIF-1 benefits to market**
-
At this point you may be asking: Ok, if this peptide is so wonderful for depression why on earth isn't it available as treatment? Well, the first answer is quite simple: It's the economy stupid! Or the 'patent economy' in this case. You see, MIF-1 is an endogenous peptide produced naturally in the brain. It can't be patented! and that means no rational pharmaceutical company would pour money into large-scale studies, marketing and the legal procedures required to bring this to market.  

The second answer is Beagle dogs. You see, a company by the name of 'Innapharma Inc'  Tried to create a patentable peptide with a structure similar to that of MIF-1 called: Nemifitide ([INN-00835](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemifitide)). During testing of Nemifitide, formation's of vacuoles were found in the brain's of Beagle dogs and that got the FDA to halt clinical testing of Nemifitide. Later testing in rhesus monkeys showed no such effect on the brain. However, The company lost its momentum and the remaining years of their patent protection had decreased which caused more problems. They eventually went bankrupt and that was the end of Nemifitide. You can blame the FDA if you like, but Beagle dogs are supposed to be 'man's best friend' and they failed us that time!

involving MIF-1 and other peptides*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196978115000716)

Fortunately, it appears a company by the name of *Akhu Therapeutics* is taking over the mission of bringing MIF-1's anti-depressant properties to the public. And they are doing that with 'Melanocortin 5 receptor blockers' or MC5R blockers for short. Thay filed a total of nine patent applications for the use of MC5R blockers to treat anxiety and depression and 'Dr. Morgan' who works there 'claims' that their MC5R blockers take effect in as little as one hour.

**MIF-1 mechanism of action and more**
-
According to Rudolph  H. Ehrensing the mechanism of action is still unknown but may have something to do with c-Fos expression:

> Over the years we were asked what the mechanism of action of  MIF-1 might be, how it affected the brain.  There were many studies that had ruled out various mechanisms of action.  In  2010 studies in Abba’s lab demonstrated that  MIF increased c-Fos expression in brain regions involved in the regulation of mood,  anxiety, depression, and memory.
*Source - (Rudolph  H.  Ehrensing 2015) An extraordinary relationship involving MIF-1 and other peptides.*

I don't know why Ehrensing doesn't mention anything about the Melanocortin as being one of the possible explanation's behind MIF-1's anti-depressant effects. After all, we know about the importance of this system thanks to the Stanford article and there are also studies showing that blocking certain Melanocortin receptors such as MC4 with antagonists produces [anti-depressant effects on mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17584135).

There is also MC5R blockers that at least according to Dr. Morgan from 'Akhu Therapeutics' are highly effective for depression. 
MIF-1 blocks alpha-MSH which as we know binds to receptors MC4 and MC5, so there is that.

There is also some [evidence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0091305779900108) that MIF-1 increases dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain after a few days of injection. What's more, MIF-1 has been found to be a [positive allosteric modulator of the D2 and D4 dopamine receptors](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/3/1228) meaning it makes those receptors more sensitive to agonists. This all tells us that MIF-1 has some complex effects on the dopamine system and there is, in fact, evidence that MIF-1 could also be useful for Parkinson's disease: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37848),[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18551198_Effect_of_Melanocyte-Stimulating_Hormone-Release_Inhibiting_Factor_MIF_in_Parkinson's_Syndrom),[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-09220-0_35)

MIF-1 also acts on the opioid system and has been found to block the [effects of morphine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305784800830?via%3Dihub).

We can conclude from all this that injection of MIF-1 leads to many changes in the brain, some of which have significant therapeutic effects. With all these effects, MIF-1 may also have value as a nootropic but this needs to be studied further. ([more info on MIF-1](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpep/2010/537639/))


**MIF-1 availability and missed potential**
-

From all my research on this, I just don't understand why this peptide has been forgotten the way it has. Is it really all because it can't be patented? Cause that just sucks. It seems to have so much potential!

For depression, MIF-1 is not merely helpful, it's extremely effective, even outperforming this [small-scale study with ayahuasca](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/01/27/103531.full.pdf) on the MARDS score after 7 days! That's without even mentioning the long-lasting sustained improvements of MIF-1 (6+ months for 60% of patients!)

I think it would be great if some of the nootropic sellers out there could make MIF-1 available somehow. It's also worth noting that MIF-1 appears to be very safe considering that it's an endogenous peptide and has had more testing on humans than some of the nootropics used here. 

Currently, some of the places I found selling it are: *hellobio*, *cpcscientific*, *bachem*, *phoenixpeptide* and *peptides international* (*pepnet*).

I'm interested to hear all of your thoughts on this. Should MIF-1 be dug out of its grave or should it be left forgotten as just another peptide with some theoretical benefits?

Here is at least what [Rudolph  H.  Ehrensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196978115000716) thinks:

>*After that invitation to do research with him (Abba  J.  Kastin)  in  1972,  my research collaboration with Abba continued. The next two decades of study involved  MIF-1  (prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide) and mental depression.  We conducted three double-blind clinical studies.  The results showed that most patients had a significant improvement in depression...*

>*...At the end of our careers, we both hope that somehow MIF-1 with  its rapid onset of action could become available to the public for the alleviation of mental depression.  But regardless of whatever happens to MIF-1,  what Abba and I have received from our research together is a  deep, deep friendship filled with respect and  affection that has a value beyond all measure.*

I've struggled with depression for a long time, but during my first year of college it became too much for me to handle. I dropped out after the end of my first semester.

Nootropic drugs seemed like a quick fix for my depression as well as a better alternative to my recreational drug use. I was looking for anything to help turn my life around. I was prescribed antidepressants but received no benefits from them. I searched online for legal alternatives to Zoloft which lead me to experiment with various nootropics. 

Nootropics Review (What Worked)

Bacopa: I took Bacopa extract twice a day for a total of 3 months. It combined very well with oxiracetam, When taken in combination colors were enhanced, thought patterns were clear and focused, and the lethargy from bacopa was alleviated. Bacopa helped to slow down racing thoughts. I felt at peace when taking it. My time on bacopa was a very zen experience. Although I liked bacopa, it did cause some side effects including extreme lethargy, demotivation, and diarrhea. The demotivating effects and the diarrhea went away after the first week, however the feeling of constant tiredness never subsided. I did notice subjective memory improvements mostly in the form of deeper, vivid, visual memories. Overall I found Bacopa useful although it was not a perfect solution to my problems. In my experience, it's benefits are for more than just memory improvement.

Oxiracetam: This is my favorite racetam. When dosed I feel stimulated and logical. It was great when taken during my statistics class. I actually made less simple calculation errors during math tests which improved my overall marks. The only negative side effect I experienced was anxiety when combined with other stimulants.

Rhodiola Rosea: This one worked well for me for a few weeks. When cycled for a few days I could definitely feel positive effects. I was not expecting much from this herb but it improved my mood and made me more talkative at work. Rhodiola however can be very hit or miss. Somedays I felt notable effects while other days I felt almost nothing. The greatest negative effect I felt was an increase in blood pressure. I find this feeling very distracting.

Semax: I took a few 2 week cycles on semax. It gave me notable stimulation and a clear headed feeling. There was no withdrawal effects when discontinued.

Caffeine and Theanine: I don't think any explanation is needed for this one.

Modafinil: I know this drug does not get much appreciation in the nootropic community but I find it very helpful. It is powerful, fast acting and completely removes fatigue which for me is essential. There is also no withdrawal effects. Surprisingly, the next  day afterglow is strong enough that redosing is not necessary for me. 

ALCAR: This supplement improves focus and mental clarity. When taken by itself brain fog is completely removed and I feel sharp as a knife.

Nootropics Review (What didn't work)

Alpha GPC: I took this to offset piracetam headaches, but unfortunately I react negatively to excess choline supplementation. This one actually caused my depression to re-emerge in full force. I was very irritable towards friends and family, feelings of pleasure were dulled, life felt bleak and hopeless. When I stopped taking it the depression subsided.

Piracetam: I got very little effect from piracetam. I took it every day for a few weeks because I read that effects built overtime. I don't think I ever got the dosage right because there is so much misinformation about proper piracetam use. This nootropic is probably not worth taking for healthy individuals. I will say it combined well with bacopa, however by itself it does not stand out to me. 

Noopept: I have not yet taken noopept properly. I used it sporadically for a few weeks. due to its short half life, I find it inconvenient to take longterm. It is also very difficult to measure accurately. I avoid nootropics which take up to much time from my day. I find constant, careful redosing very distracting.

Tianeptine: I took this about a month after stopping Zoloft. I believe that tianeptine does work as a mood stabilizer and a general mood booster. It definitely has notable effects in higher doses. Like noopept, the issue with this drug is its short half life. Needing to redose 3 times a day is very inconvenient. Tianeptine is expensive, and inconvenient to dose. It was not worth my time.

Gotu Kola: It did help me in the short term but, I don't think that targeting the gabaergic system is a good way to stop anxiety. Anything that targets this system will eventually cause rebound anxiety or dependency. I am trying to avoid being dependant on any drugs.  

Poly drug use and nootropics: I found that stacking to many nootropics caused problems. Nootropic supplements are under researched. Interactions between nootropics are almost completely unknown territory. I probably did more harm than good with my initial nootropic combinations. At one point I was taking tianeptine, noopept and semax every morning. It did cover up my depression, but I also developed severe brain fog after the first week of use. As for recreational drugs, some things combine well with nootropics while others do not. The more you take the more complicated these interactions get. I have slowly found out that less is more. 

Conclusions: I thoroughly enjoy experimenting with nootropics. Although I wasted some money here and there, it was all worth it. I have kept my depression at bay and decreased my dependence on recreational drugs. I transferred to a new college and I am maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I have come to terms with my depression; I feel much better about myself and my future. 
I do not owe all of this to nootropics alone. I have developed positive habits like journaling, working out, meditation, and intermittent fasting. Nootropics were useful because they made each day a little easier. I was able to push myself a little harder with limited side effects.  I will continue my nootropic use as long as I see benefits. Nootropics did not immediately change my life like I imagined, but I still feel that they are useful.

Oxiracetam

Fasoracetam

Coluracetam

Phenylpiracetam

&#x200B;

Oxiracetam does diddly-dick for me, went through 3 small containers thinking it actually did something.

Nothing at all, nadda, zilch, jack shit. Doesn't matter the dose. Non responder I guess.

Coluracetam is unpridictable, total hit or miss. Sometimes I get an enhancement in colors, and mood elevation, nothing for cognition, but half the time it gives me weird skizo side effects where I get after images when turning my head, sensitivity to light, fatigue, and even depression.

Phenylpiracetam is pretty awesome, only ever use it on workout days, I can push myself so hard in the gym I nearly puke, I don't get as lightheaded from deadlifts and squats because of the oxygen utilization. Eliminates fatigue. Tastes like Satans taint.

Now for the pis de resistance... motherfucking Fasoracetam...

What a treat this has been..seriously!

Fasoracetam enhances just about every part of my cognitive abilities, I am less forgetful, I can drive better, especially with a manual transmission, it has a remarkable anxiolytic effect, increased sociability, better organizational skills, better verbal fluency, better mood, and perhaps even more surprising, better sleep on days I use it. Whenever I am having a conversation on say 20mg of sublingual faso, people seem to really lock eyes with me, and you can tell they notice how much clearer I'm coming across, especially my family friends and co-workers.

Probably the best part of all this, is I never experienced tolerance. Granted I only ever take it a couple times a week, and often go 1-3 weeks without any at all, but boy do I ever notice days off from faso.

Combine it with Sulbutiamine, and I'm basically unstoppable lol.

I do use about 4-500mg phenibut twice a week, and I find if I take faso within 24 hours, it can actually go the other way and make me kind of irritated, slightly anxious.

&#x200B;

I REALLY think there needs to be more conversation and study regarding this novel little wonder drug.

Side note, I have also tried noopept, which also did jack for me. I have yet to try regular Piracetam.",2019-09-30 03:33:03

Studies seem to suggest Feverfew herb (and not pure parthenolide) could have a somewhat unique and paradoxical ability to regenerate axons in the Central Nervous system.,139,8jxr9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8jxr9j/studies_seem_to_suggest_feverfew_herb_and_not/,40,1526527755.0,"I respond well to brain anti-inflammatories.  I came across Feverfew, which is sparingly mentioned here (only three search results for it on the whole subreddit) but seems to be quite effective.  Advantages, disadvantages, hopes, concerns, I would like a discussion.  Yes, animal models of mice and rat are used in these studies.  This might be TLDR but bear with me.


I will provide evidence for some points concerning Feverfew

First, it should be realized that a regular formulation of Feverfew might actually be favored over pure Parthenolide, its most well-known ingredient.  Parthenolide has [anti-inflammatory properties] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11514225) on its own, and studies beyond the one I posted which showcase this, but Feverfew also [contains several flavonoids] (https://examine.com/supplements/feverfew/) including apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, and chrysin. 

 Apigenin alone is [0.5% weight of dry leaves] (https://examine.com/supplements/feverfew/) and [can inhibit COX-2, PGE-2, TNF-α, and iNOS] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750400).  [Luteolin] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12230117), [Quercetin] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808895/), and [Chrysin] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28609844) are also all anti-inflammatories respectively, and there are even more compounds like this in feverfew.  their combined effect is likely synergistic with the parthenolide.  Apigenin, even in this seemingly small amount, is potent (chamomile!), and is attributed with causing the [anxiolytic effect of Feverfew] (https://examine.com/supplements/feverfew).

Second, The role of GSK3 in nerve recovery seems to be puzzling and somewhat contradictory.  It has been thought that increased GSK3 has been implicated in [dementia-related neurodegeneration] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19391164).  [Parthenolide actually ""mimics"" GSK-3] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502600/) to some extent and has been shown to promote peripheral nerve recovery on its own.  So, why does elevated GSK3 produce different results for central versus peripheral nerves?  [This 2017 study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502600/) involving parthenolide seems to have found something striking: that elevated GSK3 can actually help CNS axon regeneration, if paired with a GSK3B inhibitor.


""Strikingly, expression of CRMP2T/A in GSK3S/A RGCs further boosted optic nerve regeneration, with axons reaching the optic chiasm within 3 wk. Thus, **active GSK3 can also markedly promote axonal growth in central nerves if CRMP2 concurrently remains active**""


""In this respect, it might be more feasible to combine parthenolide, which mimics the effects of GSK3 activation by direct inhibition of tubulin detyrosination (32), **with pharmacological GSK3 inhibition, for example, by lithium, to reduce CRMP2 inactivation** and efficient activation of the intrinsic growth potential, for example, with IS or hyper–IL-6 (48)""

It's a bit of a paradox.

They understand parthenolide mimics GSK3.  They speak of using lithium, the most thought-of GSK3B inhibitor to go with parthenolide.  But, weirdly, there is not mention of the other compounds I have discussed.  Why?  They have shown they are likely involved in the effects of feverfew.  Upon further research, I've found that all of these: [apigenin, luteolin, quercetin] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21443429), and even [chrysin] (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mnfr.201500801), and yes, even [the small amount] (https://examine.com/supplements/feverfew/) of [melatonin] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23402899), are **all GSK3B inhibitors**.  Apigenin and luteolin are thought to be potent ones at that.  They're all in Feverfew already! So, why add in lithium at all? Why not use a good dose of a regular, aerial part formulation?  It is entirely reasonable so suggest it could do what the study is saying, right?


If I am correct, Feverfew is a rather unique herb, and can feasibly boost CNS axon recovery in a more involved way, and even possibly a more effective way.",2018-05-17 08:59:15

We are currently designing and building an MVP which will contain the following features: 

* Tracking (manual entry and automated via sync with health apps)   
   * Biohacks (supplements, nutrition, fitness, mind, sleep)
   * Self-reported mind data (anxiety, focus, memory, motivation, mood)
   * Biomarkers
* Reminders - push notifications (e.g. when you need to take your supplements or start a meditation session)
* Analytics - Analyze the effects of your biohacking through both biomarker data and self-reported mind data.

It will integrate and pull your health/fitness data from Fitbit, Apple Health, and Google Fit

We will use the same categories from the [2017 Reddit Nootropics survey](https://darktka.github.io/) to track self-reported mind data such as anxiety, focus, memory, motivation, and mood.

I don't want to get into the long road that led me here. But it involved nootropics, and it involved googling every possible medical condition relating to my symptoms and scaring myself in the process.

Last night, after laying in bed for 2 hours too uncomfortable to sleep, looking on the internet on my phone, I found reason to believe that massaging my neck might potentially alleviate my symptoms. Wasn't expecting anything, but I tried to dig deep into my neck/shoulder area around my spinal cord, and then I hit one spot and instantly knew it was good. RELIEF. I started stretching and massaging all along my neck and back, and it felt like life was flowing back into my brain. I experienced euphoria. Few hours later after I calmed down I slept like a baby. Felt a little stiff when I woke up, but all day today I've been *moving* around, stretching, massaging my back more. Took a nice warm shower... And usually when I get out of the shower I lay down on a towel and rest while I dry. There was no urge to stop standing this time.

Few hours ago I tried to put more focus on my upper neck area and head. And *holy shit*.... My spine is straight! Well, I didn't know it wasn't straight. But it was curved a bit at the top, leaving myself naturally hunched and looking down. I feel like a giraffe right now.

At least, with my neck. Physically, and mentally, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from my body.

I am excited to start exercising. For the first time in months it isn't exhausting to move.

What are your top 3 nootropics?,135,31ir4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/31ir4b/what_are_your_top_3_nootropics/,195,1428271997.0,"Would be nice if everyone can share their top 3 nootropics that has been the MOST BENEFICIAL TO YOUR LIFE. I don't care how powerful the effects are, whether it's short term/long term...etc. Would be nice if you could provide a short write-up to how it benefited you. 

Personally, I will exclude exercise and meditation because I feel that they are fundamentally different from nootropics. If you wish to include them though, go ahead.

I will start off first:

1. Noopept

Ever since I found my sweet spot for the dosage, this thing improved my overall memory, cured some neurological problems like weird gait due to anxiety and improved my focus and sleep. Tons of other benefit but I will avoid sensationalising. Cycling and finding out your perfect dosage can be a pain though.

2. Creatine

Everytime I take this thing, my brain starts flowing faster and I get all hyped up and it seems to be very synergistic with noopept. However, the effects are relatively short term and it always causes me to shake my leg uncontrollably just like Restless Leg Syndrome.

3. Coffee

This thing is like a short term fix to almost any physiological problems. Any time I need to get rid of fatigue, lack of motivation...etc., I just down a cup of coffee and I am good to go. Unfortunately, tolerance builds up really quick and I normally can only use it like 2 times a week at most otherwise it loses its efficacy and becomes detrimental instead.

NAC helped me queet weed,136,eukotl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/eukotl/nac_helped_me_queet_weed/,93,1580139012.0,"On new years eve I had a pretty profound trip on psychedelics that made me realize smoking dope is a no no for me, I was smoking everyday for about 2 years and the negative effects really got to me - brain fog, poor concentration, poor sentence formation and most importantly major memory loss. I've tried quitting a couple times but the cravings were always so strong that I eventually caved in.

Cue the first of January and my quitting journey has began - I started off nice but the cravings came back and I had NAC and knew that there was some evidence of it suppressing cravings so I started taking 600mg at morning and 600mg at night.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised, my cravings were reduced by about ~80% and I haven't thought much of them, I still had the desire to smoke but it was really easy to subdue.

Aaand after that, as of today (27th of January) I am well, 27 days free of weed!

If anyone is planning to quit smoking weed / cigarettes or stop drinking considering pairing this supplement with your journey, it really helped me take the edge off.",2020-01-27 21:00:12
Nootropics that are personally working for me and longterm thoughts,137,ebs0g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ebs0g0/nootropics_that_are_personally_working_for_me_and/,79,1576592302.0,"I have been dealing with depression since when I was a kid. I am not sure what contributed to it and whether it is genetic. I assume it has something to do with poor nutrition combined with poor environment and life style with very little awareness as to what is good for a human. Anyway, that's the past. In order to address my depression along with myriad other health issues, I tried several approaches including heavy exercise, medication (anti-depressants), supplements and nootropics. After all these experiments, let me categorically state that \_nothing\_ works as well as sleep, exercise, meditation and diet. If you don't address these, it doesn't matter what else you do, you will never be where you want to be. The most potent cognitive enhancer that I came across is happiness. When you are happy, you can accomplish stuff that you think are impossible. That said, this is nootropics community so, there are at least few things that do work and can aid you in your health and happiness.

## Things that really worked

Clean diet - Although I mentioned nootropics above. I want to reiterate that none of them worked when I wasn't eating cleanly. My digestive system is a mess because of which I have trouble digesting. Removing some allergens and eating very little processed foods has significantly improved my mood and life.

Probiotics - Specifically these two ([https://klaire.com/k-tf6-therbiotic-factor-6](https://klaire.com/k-tf6-therbiotic-factor-6) and [https://klaire.com/k-bsp-12-biospora](https://klaire.com/k-bsp-12-biospora)) - When I take these two together, my mood significantly improves, I sleep less and I feel well rested. I tested this multiple times over a period of few weeks taking them on and off, just to make sure that these are what are improving my mood. When I take them together, I consistently wake up with less sleep (almost an hour). I am experiencing no negatives by taking them.

Vitamin D3 with K2 - I won't waste too much time explaining why. If I don't take them, depression creeps up without even noticing. I don't take them continuously but I try to take at least 75% of the days. (5000 IU)

NAC (1200mg) - It helped a lot in reducing my depression symptoms. It also reduced my impulsiveness slightly. I took continuously for 3 months before taking a break. I also experimented combining this with B complex and that improved my focus levels considerably. However, I had to stop taking B complex because it seem to take away my drive to do things so even though it improves focus, I just didn't want to do anything. However, NAC was still working great. I am currently taking a break from it.

Lions Mane Mushroom - Powdercity used to have a version that worked really really well. It significantly improved my mood but I wasn't able to find an equivalent version since they closed down. Also, this is very diuretic and so it's causing other issues in terms of night time waking so I stopped taking.

LSD micro dose (\~8 mcg) - This also reduces depressive symptoms and makes me slightly more social. It also improved my sleep quality. Before taking this, I used to wake up every midnight to pee. Although that seems like a minor issue, waking up reduced my quality of sleep considerably to the point that I was considering taking sleep medication. I have no idea how/why but since I started microdosing LSD, I no longer wake up in the middle of the night and I sleep much better. I follow Fadiman's protocol. I haven't experienced any negatives so far. However, keep in mind that, this is not a miracle drug like some people make it to be. It only slightly alleviates depression. I experienced more relief from probiotics than this but it does seem to aid as well.

Apart from the ones mentioned above, I also tried several supplements like Magnesium, Ashwagandha, Bacopa, Noopept, Piracetam, Ginseng, Uridine, etc., They all worked in their own ways but everyone of them had some or other negatives. Ashwagandha caused inflammatory symptoms. Bacopa makes me irritable and causes me to urinate frequently (with a consistent feeling that there is some more to pee). Noopept dramatically reduced my short-term memory to the point that I was very concerned about its effects. Piracetam sometimes made me hypomanic or caused brain fog. I didn't like the after-effects of it, which made it a no go. Ginseng gave great energy but I paid that back the next day when I felt completely drained. Same thing with Uridine.

In general, after a lot of experimentation, I realized that all of these are just tools that can probably help you reset whatever damage you may have done by giving you enough energy to focus on your diet, sleep and exercise. Ultimately, I don't think nootropics are the solution. At most, the best of them will put you in a positive state of mind (with some energy) where you can accomplish what you set out to accomplish. However, the real solution is not in \_a\_ state of mind but rather being able to easily navigate between states of mind and having the self awareness to address your own thought patterns to move forward in life. If so, you are better off focusing on doing just that in the form of meditation. That's what I intend to focus on.",2019-12-17 19:48:22
"Chromium Picolinate: Surprisingly effective for my depression, brain fog, anhedonia.",135,d8or70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/d8or70/chromium_picolinate_surprisingly_effective_for_my/,47,1569367639.0,"Diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder comorbid with OCD and intrusive thoughts; and ADD mostly Inattentive. Been Struggling with severe brain fog, apathy, loss of interest in everything, extreme carb cravings, constant drowsiness and low energy for many years.
   SSRI's helped slightly. Vyvanse helped moderately in some ways but has proven unreliable on a daily basis and still insufficient.
  I started taking Chromium Picolinate on a whim because I was hoping it would help with my carb cravings at least. But I found that in addition to diminishing my ravenous appetite it also greatly improved my interest in life, overall energy levels, and cognitive issues.
    I did some research and apparently there have been studies showing chromium can help people with certain forms of atypical depression or similar neurological disorders. I am taking 600mcg of Chromium Picolinate daily in the morning. Keep in mind though I am still taking my anti-depressant and Vyvanse so there might be a bolstering or synergistic effect. But I wanted to share this with anyone struggling with similar treatment resistant conditions.
    It took less then a week for me to notice improvement, so if it does nothing for you after two weeks you it probably isn't for you. I suggest starting at 400mcg and highly suggest not exceeding 600mcg to prevent entering the danger zone.


P.S. Had all my issues prior to taking medications so it's not a side effect of my prescriptions before that comes up.",2019-09-25 04:57:19

Dosing 400mg of L-Theanine has removed physical anxiety symptoms in me.,133,8dsxrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/8dsxrg/dosing_400mg_of_ltheanine_has_removed_physical/,56,1524306129.0,"I've been using these L-Theanine gummies, which are around 100mg each.

Recently in my life, I've developed a high amount of anxiety that has manifested into physical symptoms. Among these are chest pains, trouble breathing, ""waves"" of nervousness, sweaty palms, so on.

Today I decided to take L-Theanine to try and relax. Initially, I only took 200mg, but after around 15 - 20 minutes, I took 200mg more.

Interestingly enough, it's successfully eliminated the feeling of physical distress and anxiousness and has brought on a far more relaxed feeling. This exact thing happened to me when I took 400mg a month or so ago when I was feeling the same thing.

On my end, this is a huge breakthrough. While I can deal with mental anxiety and brush it aside, once I start feeling physical symptoms, I fly into a panic and become dysfunctional. Dosing 400mg of L-Theanine appears to have helped considerably.",2018-04-21 15:52:09

Important reminder: The fact that you start feeling better after starting a new noot is not evidence that the noot is effective.,138,5vflhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5vflhy/important_reminder_the_fact_that_you_start/,33,1487754419.0,"Reading through comments as of late makes it seem like we're going a bit astray with what constitutes evidence of a noot's validity. This is a scientific community collectively looking for rigorously tested and/or scientifically supported means of improving our performance. Personal anecdotes after starting a new supplement are interesting, fun to read, and absolutely belong in this sub, but not as causal evidence. 

First and most obviously, correlation =/= causation. We all do a lot of different things regarding diet, exercise, socializing, practicing mindfulness, stressing, other nootropics, etc. All of these can impact daily performance. 

Second, the placebo effect is a real and widespread phenomenon. Even dismissing the confounding variables listed above, the fact that you took something and felt better does not mean the physical properties of that thing are responsible. You stopped taking the noot and the beneficial effects went away? Still not scientifically useful.

Third, as a community we like nootropics. We believe in the ability of supplements to make us better in all kinds of ways. This is why we must be especially careful of what we accept as evidence - the risk of succumbing to confirmation bias. This is how every beginner (myself especially) gets sucked into buying way more supplements than they need - they want the stories of improvement through a pill to be true, so they decide it is.

This is not to say that personal stories or feelings about noots should be completely dismissed from discussion - they are interesting and fun to read for sure. Rather just that they should not be conflated with evidence, which becomes so easy to do when getting excited about a new noot.

Hope this doesn't come off too high and mighty. This sub changed my life, but that happened because people were willing to do the legitimate research to determine what works and what doesn't.",2017-02-22 14:36:59
"Most people are deficient in Magnesium, Vitamin D or both.

While almost everyone gets enough of most vitamins and minerals from food, deficiencies in Vitamin D are common because of a lack of exposure to sunlight nowadays. Magnesium deficiencies are common because people don't eat enough unprocessed foods, and also because plant soil has less Magnesium today than it used to have centuries ago.

Therefore, this makes most of the vitamins and minerals in multi-vitamins useless for most people, since most people are not usually deficient in most of the vitamins in it.

The results are very surprising, as I never would have guessed it. It turns out the substance is diphenhydramine, also known as Benadryl. Diphenhydramine has anticholinergic and serotonergic effects, and has been known to cause seizures in higher doses. So essentially people were overdosing on a deliriant. You can read reports of people taking large doses of it online, and it does not seem like a very pleasurable experience.

[Here are the spectra results.](http://i.imgur.com/SlHOkou.jpg)

So far Cerebral Health has not taken any steps to address the issue. I've gone back and forth with the owner Doug on Longecity for a while now, and the exchange has pretty much been a PR disaster for him. Not only has he been rude and dismissive, but he has threatened myself and the lab manager of the first lab we used to do the testing with litigation. On top of that, he insulted the lab managers education, and generally has been a total asshole throughout this whole incident. It's definitely not the type of person that I want to give my business to, and the way he is running his business is damaging to the Nootropics community as a whole. It's incidents like this that are going to be the downfall of our community. We need to send a message that this is not acceptable.

Thank you to Nootropics Depot for helping us with the identification of the substance.",2013-11-27 13:46:28
