# 🕹️ Pac-Man Portfolio | Built with Phaser.js

"A developer's personality is just as vital as the code they write."

This interactive portfolio reimagines my career path as a high-stakes level of **Pac-Man**. Rather than scrolling through a flat, static resume, visitors are invited to navigate a custom-built maze where every corner reveals a different chapter of my technical background.

## 🚀 The Vision
By leveraging **Phaser’s Arcade Physics** and **Tilemaps**, I’ve turned traditional navigation into a tactile, gamified experience. This project serves as a technical demonstration of how web technologies can transform a standard professional summary into an engaging, memorable journey.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Engine:** [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) (v3.60+)
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Physics:** Arcade Physics System
* **Graphics:** HTML5 Canvas / WebGL
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## 🕹️ Features
* **Dynamic Maze:** Responsive tilemap design that scales for the browser.
* **Power-Up Skills:** Scroll through each pellet to see detailed views of my technical stack.
* **Interactive Resume:** Navigate through different "stages" representing Education, Experience, Projects & About me.
* **Retro Aesthetics:** Authentic 8-bit sound effects and classic arcade styling.
